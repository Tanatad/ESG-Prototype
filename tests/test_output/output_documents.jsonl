In addition, if a company is able to assess climate-related risks and establish mitigation measures for such risks, it will be able to identify opportunities to integrate renewable energy into its business.\n\n4\n\nA greenhouse gas has the property of absorbing heat or infrared radiation, which helps to stabilize the Earth’s atmospheric temperature. However, if the volume of greenhouse gases becomes too high, this will cause the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to the current problem where greenhouse gases are significant contributors to negative environmental impacts and climate change. All sectors of society are therefore encouraging businesses to manage reductions in the seven greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen fluoride (NF3).\n\n4 ), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur\n\n57\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gases are emitted from different organizational activities, for example from electricity use in production processes or services, and fuel use in transportation. If a company is consistently emitting more greenhouse gas emissions but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this reveals an imbalance between its energy and resource requirements compared to its ability to generate profit. It also reveals the environmental impacts that a company causes from its operations. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its business activities. 2. Greenhouse gas emissions by source, reported in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO\n\n2e),\n\nacross three scopes: Scope 1:\n\nDirect greenhouse gas emissions, such as from combustion in machinery use, transport fleets, and chemicals used for wastewater treatment and cooling systems.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

In addition, if a company is able to assess climate-related risks and establish mitigation measures for such risks, it will be able to identify opportunities to integrate renewable energy into its business.\n\n4\n\nA greenhouse gas has the property of absorbing heat or infrared radiation, which helps to stabilize the Earth’s atmospheric temperature. However, if the volume of greenhouse gases becomes too high, this will cause the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to the current problem where greenhouse gases are significant contributors to negative environmental impacts and climate change. All sectors of society are therefore encouraging businesses to manage reductions in the seven greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen fluoride (NF3).\n\n4 ), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur\n\n57\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gases are emitted from different organizational activities, for example from electricity use in production processes or services, and fuel use in transportation. If a company is consistently emitting more greenhouse gas emissions but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this reveals an imbalance between its energy and resource requirements compared to its ability to generate profit. It also reveals the environmental impacts that a company causes from its operations. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its business activities. 2. Greenhouse gas emissions by source, reported in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO\n\n2e),\n\nacross three scopes: Scope 1:\n\nDirect greenhouse gas emissions, such as from combustion in machinery use, transport fleets, and chemicals used for wastewater treatment and cooling systems.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4.

Applicability and Scope of Project\n\nThe nature of the activity must be a project that generates electricity from renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, and biomass energy, etc., by generating electricity for distribution into the electricity grid. or to sell to the electricity grid and use it yourself However, more than one technology can be used together to produce electricity.\n\nProject scope is electricity generation system from the project's renewable energy including\n\nvarious activities related to the Electricity generation of the project\n\nThere are characteristics of activities that fall into the additional scope. The details are as\n\nfollows.\n\n1) Hydroelectric power generation with a reservoir that meets at least one of the following\n\nconditions:\n\n(a) Project activities are carried out on existing reservoirs without changing the volume\n\nof the reservoir.\n\n(b) Project activities carried out in existing reservoirs; The volume of the reservoir increases and the power density of the project activities. According to the conditions set for greenhouse gas emissions from project implementation more than 4 W\/m2 (c) Project activities result in a new reservoir and power density of the power plant meeting the conditions set for project implementation GHG emissions greater than 4 W\/m2\n\n2) Project activities with the installation of new power generating units with components that use renewable energy and non-renewable (e.g., generating electricity from wind power coupled with diesel fuel). Project activities including renovation, rehabilitation, or replacement of the power generation system to replace the old one can be used.\n\n3) Electricity generation using cogeneration systems cannot use this method.\n\n4) Projects related to capacity increase cannot use this methodology.\n\n5) In the case of project activities that are generating electricity from gas from landfills Biogas from decomposing organic matter from waste and biogas from wastewater treatment Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from methane emissions avoided by recycling, use another methodology for calculations. But if the project developer has an activity that uses methane to produce electricity to sell to the electricity grid, this methodology can be used.\n\nThailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization) (TGO)\n\npage 5\n\nThailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Program\n\nT-VER-P-METH-01-01 Version 01","page 6\n\nThailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Program\n\nT-VER-P-METH-01-01 Version 01\n\n5.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic.

Management and staff of listed companies\n\nThis Guide is suitable for listed companies of all sizes, in all industries. Its purpose is to enable managers to understand and recognize the importance of sustainability information, and to help them prepare for reporting to relevant audiences. These could include the company secretariat, investor relations professionals, and departments within the company including risk management, organizational strategy development, and communications.\n\n, business development, human resources, sustainability\n\n14\n\nAnalysts, securities managers, and investors This Guide will provide analysts, securities managers, and investors with important information on a listed company’s sustainability disclosures. It will help them in their decisions to invest in businesses that operate with good governance, and which consider economic, social, and environmental risks.\n\n2.\n\n15\n\n03\n\nSustainability Reporting Guidelines\n\nSustainability Reporting Principles\n\nThe Stock Exchange of Thailand has identified the following sustainability reporting principles for listed companies, which will enable them to produce quality reports that will benefit both those preparing and using the information:\n\n1. Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations","18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process.

Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","Sales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management. They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.","4.

Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1.

Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1.

This will help to stimulate interest for readers, make content easier to memorize, and enhance communications efficiency.\n\n3.\n\n21\n\n04\n\nElements of Sustainability Reporting\n\n4.1 Part 1:\n\nEssential Information\n\nCompanies should provide an overview of their business operations, as this will help information users to understand their operational context and the business activities that affect stakeholders. Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions. Examples include pricing, advertisements, and announcements.\n\nCustomer Services Activities related to enhancing customer satisfaction after sales, to retain customers for the repeat purchases of products and services. Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights\n\nS2 Fair Labor Practices S3 Responsibility to Customers\/Consumers S4 Responsibility to Communities\/Societies\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension (G) G1 Policy, Structure and Governance System\n\nG2 Sustainability Policy and Strategy G3 Sustainability Risk Management G4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G5 Innovation Development\n\nExplanation\n\nBusiness activities can impact the qualities of life and human rights of many groups of stakeholders. To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1.

Additional references: - GRI Standards - Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) - Integrated Reporting Framework\n\nCore (C) Indicators\n\nRecommended (R) Indicators\n\nGRI Standards\n\nSDGs\n\nG3 Sustainability Risk Management G3.5R G3.1C Standards on sustainability Sustainability risk risk management management policy and guidelines G3.2C ESG risks and opportunities G3.3C Emerging risks G3.4C Business continuity plans (BCP)\n\nGRI 102-15: Key impacts, risks, and opportunities\n\nGoal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\n\nRationale • Sustainability risk management approach Economic, social and environmental uncertainty could lead to errors, damages, or undesirable events or actions, which in turn could prevent a company from conducting its activities or completing projects according to target. Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) - CDP (previously Carbon Disclosure Project) - SDG Compass: The guide for business action on the SDGs - WFE ESG Guidance and Metrics by the World Federation of Exchanges - Model Guidance on Reporting ESG Information to Investors by the UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Initiative\n\n13\n\nMeasuring Stakeholder Capitalism: Towards Common Metrics and y the World Economic )\n\nOther sustainability reporting guidelines prepared b markets\n\nOther sustainability reporting guidelines prepared b markets\n\n2.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies to disclose information concerning their environmental, social, and governance performance across their entire business value chain.\n\nForm 56-1 One Report\n\n2. Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has developed the Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies to provide them with a clear reporting framework and sustainability performance indicators that respond to the needs of investors and stakeholders in the Thai context. International Sustainability Reporting Guidelines\n\n3. There are various international sustainability reporting standards available, including the GRI Standards, Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework, and Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The Stock Exchange of Thailand encourages listed companies to voluntary disclose information according to these international standards, as appropriate.\n\n1 For more information, please refer to the Form 56-1 (One Report) Reporting \/ Annual Report Manual.\n\n9\n\n02\n\nAbout this Guide\n\nO\n\nb\n\njectives","(2) Stakeholder expectations Companies should briefly explain the expectations and needs of each\n\nstakeholder group, for example:\n\nStakeholder Group Shareholders\n\nEmployees\n\nCustomers\n\nSuppliers\n\nCommunities\/Societies\n\nExpectations\/Needs Business transparency and regular returns on investment Fair compensation and career progression Good quality and appropriately priced products and services Fair and transparent procurement practices Protection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\n27\n\nWhen reporting on stakeholder expectations, companies should show how their business activities are linked to each stakeholder group. Stakeholders’ expectations should be assessed and analy zed at least once a year through engagement channels such as participatory hearing processes, satisfaction surveys, meetings, or other channels. Companies should use the results from these processes to develop appropriate methods of engagement to minimize risks of conflicts or sanctions against the business, such as boycotts on sales and purchases, sales of company shares, employee resignations, or protests.\n\n(3) Responding to stakeholder expectations Companies should summarize the primary methods, activities, projects,\n\nand communication channels that they use to engage with different stakeholders, such as opinion and satisfaction surveys and seminars. This information demonstrates that a company is regularly engaging with stakeholders and is committed to responding appropriately to the expectations of each stakeholder group and ensuring their satisfaction.\n\n28\n\nTable 1: Example of reporting on stakeholder engagement\n\nStakeholder Group\n\nExpectations\/ Needs\n\nExample of Response\n\nShareholders\n\nBusiness transparency and regular returns on investment\n\nDevelop an internal control system and efficient risk management\n\nTransparent disclosure of information through channels such as the annual shareholders meeting, annual report, and company website.\n\nEmployees\n\nFair compensation and career progression\n\nFair approach to compensation\n\nContinuous skills and capability development\n\nCustomers\n\nGood quality and appropriately priced products and services\n\nContinuous development of products and services\n\nFair pricing -\n\nAfter-sales services to respond to customers’ needs\n\nSuppliers\n\nFair and transparent procurement practices\n\nFair supplier practices and code of conduct for working together Development of suppliers’ skills and capabilities\n\nCommunities\/ Societies\n\nProtection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\nControl and minimization of environmental impacts from business operations - Support for community engagement and development activities, such as community career training\n\n29\n\nExample of Communication Channel\n\nShareholder meeting - Company website - Annual report\/ Sustainability report\n\nEmployee meetings - E-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nCompany website \/\n\nE-mail \/ Social media\n\nSales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management.

Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies.

Stakeholders’ expectations should be assessed and analy zed at least once a year through engagement channels such as participatory hearing processes, satisfaction surveys, meetings, or other channels. Companies should use the results from these processes to develop appropriate methods of engagement to minimize risks of conflicts or sanctions against the business, such as boycotts on sales and purchases, sales of company shares, employee resignations, or protests.\n\n(3) Responding to stakeholder expectations Companies should summarize the primary methods, activities, projects,\n\nand communication channels that they use to engage with different stakeholders, such as opinion and satisfaction surveys and seminars.

Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans.

A sustainable supply chain management process considers environmental and social impacts and good governance, as this will help to mitigate business impacts from issues such as illegal labor and corruption. It also indicates that a company is committed to building relationships with its suppliers and to develop the business while delivering positive results for the economy, society and environment, for example through continuous supplier capacity development and green procurement.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key aspects of its sustainable supply chain management policy and guidelines, or the Supplier Code of Conduct (if applicable), to demonstrate that the company has criteria for procurement covering environmental, social, and good governance practices. Examples include environmentally-friendly procurement of raw materials, products and services, and the prohibition of child or slave labor.\n\n2. Key aspects of the company’s supply chain management plan and clearly defined targets. These plans may cover mitigation measures for supplier-related economic risks (e.g., over- reliance on a small group of suppliers, receiving poor quality products\/services), social issues (e.g., human rights violations, unethical conduct towards employee and laborers), and environmental issues (e.g., environmental law violations).\n\n3. Percentage of new suppliers that passed the supplier screening criteria covering environmental, social, and good governance issues.\n\n4. Percentage of key suppliers acknowledging the company’s supplier code of conduct. Key suppliers can be identified based on procurement spend or the volume of products\/services received (if applicable).\n\n5.

Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","Conflicts with communities This describes a company’s ability to build relationships with communities and comply with relevant laws, such as those relating to community rights, human rights, and the environment. Furthermore, it demonstrates whether a company effectively handles community grievances to within manageable levels and prevents incidents from deteriorating to the extent that they interrupt business operations, or stop projects entirely. If a company has an increasing number of community conflicts or worsening trends, this reflects the possibility that its business capabilities will decrease, and that it could face higher costs associated with conflict mitigation and resolution.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key information on its community\/social policy, which demonstrates a commitment and\n\nresponsibility to protecting and reducing the impacts of its business operations on communities\/ societies, as well as guidelines or mitigation measures to address community\/social impacts. Note that this information could also be part of a company’s human rights policy and guidelines. 2. Target for developing and engaging with communities that may be affected by the business. Companies should disclose quantitative, comparable and measurable targets, for example, a reduction in the number of complaints or conflicts with communities that are caused by business activities or operations.\n\n3. Community\/social development plans that align with the company’s business context, such as:\n\nCommunity satisfaction surveys, used for developing approaches that respond to the needs of both the community and business.\n\nAnalysis of benefits that the community and company receive from community development efforts, or projects that address social issues.\n\nSupporting sustainable, self-sufficient communities by using business resources, capabilities and capacities to strengthen and elevate their qualities of life.\n\n4. Benefits from community\/social development projects or activities. This is to demonstrate the outcomes and effectiveness of a company’s community development plans. A company can disclose these benefits in financial terms, such as increased income per household, or non- financial terms, such as increase in the number of local suppliers.\n\n5. In the case that a company has conflicts with communities, it should report on the number of grievances and impacts that have occurred, as well as the mitigation and resolution measures adopted.\n\n6. Spending on projects and activities for community\/social development and assistance. This will reveal how suitable a company’s plans are and whether they are reflective of the benefits, value, and impact that the projects and activities deliver.\n\n69\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension\n\nCore (C) Indicators\n\nRecommended (R) Indicators\n\nGRI Standards\n\nSDGs\n\nG1 Policy, Structure and Governance System Board Composition G1.1C Profiles of individual directors\n\nG1.2C Number of board members\n\nG1.3C Number of independent directors\n\nGRI 102-18 Governance Structure\n\n:\n\nGoal 5: Gender Equality Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\n\nG1.4C Number of non-executive directors\n\nG1.5C Number of female directors\n\nG1.6C Independent chairman of the board\n\nG1.7C Separation of the roles of chairman and CEO\n\nG1.8C Number of independent directors in each sub-committee G1.9C Independent chairman of each sub-committee G1.10C Number of years of tenure for individual directors\n\n70\n\nRationale • Board composition Board composition is essential for demonstrating that a company’s governance structure is transparent and independent.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

A sustainable supply chain management process considers environmental and social impacts and good governance, as this will help to mitigate business impacts from issues such as illegal labor and corruption. It also indicates that a company is committed to building relationships with its suppliers and to develop the business while delivering positive results for the economy, society and environment, for example through continuous supplier capacity development and green procurement.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key aspects of its sustainable supply chain management policy and guidelines, or the Supplier Code of Conduct (if applicable), to demonstrate that the company has criteria for procurement covering environmental, social, and good governance practices.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues.

In addition, if a company is able to assess climate-related risks and establish mitigation measures for such risks, it will be able to identify opportunities to integrate renewable energy into its business.\n\n4\n\nA greenhouse gas has the property of absorbing heat or infrared radiation, which helps to stabilize the Earth’s atmospheric temperature. However, if the volume of greenhouse gases becomes too high, this will cause the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to the current problem where greenhouse gases are significant contributors to negative environmental impacts and climate change. All sectors of society are therefore encouraging businesses to manage reductions in the seven greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen fluoride (NF3).\n\n4 ), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur\n\n57\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gases are emitted from different organizational activities, for example from electricity use in production processes or services, and fuel use in transportation. If a company is consistently emitting more greenhouse gas emissions but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this reveals an imbalance between its energy and resource requirements compared to its ability to generate profit. It also reveals the environmental impacts that a company causes from its operations. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its business activities. 2. Greenhouse gas emissions by source, reported in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO\n\n2e),\n\nacross three scopes: Scope 1:\n\nDirect greenhouse gas emissions, such as from combustion in machinery use, transport fleets, and chemicals used for wastewater treatment and cooling systems.

The use of renewable energy reflects a company’s commitment to reducing its reliance on non-renewable, fossil fuel-based energy, which will help to reduce the risk of future energy shortages and the volume of greenhouse gases emitted from its business processes. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and quantitative targets to reduce electricity and\/or fuel consumption,\n\ndemonstrating its commitment to improving energy use efficiency, reducing energy waste, and continuously improving its effectiveness in managing energy requirements.","on the pre-defined metrics and adjust the plan if necessary.

Innovations may include things that have not existed before, or things that have been adapted, improved upon or modernized to improve work efficiency, enhance business competitiveness, and benefit society and the environment. However, companies should also demonstrate an innovation culture and disclose the ways in which they encourage employees to innovate and embed innovation into their work, or into products\/services to create added value for the organization.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key elements of its innovation development policy and guidelines, which show the company’s objectives and targets on innovation development in alignment with business direction and growth. This should also show a company’s internal processes for innovation development and promotion, such as innovation showcases, innovative thinking courses, etc. 2. Spending on R&D, innovation activities or innovation project plans over the past year. 3. Summary of benefits or outcomes from innovation development over the past year (if available). For example: “The company developed Innovation ‘A’, which successfully increased customer satisfaction while reducing energy costs by 10%, leading to a cost savings of 300,000 baht and a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous year.” Companies do not need to disclose confidential information so that they can minimize the risk of infringing on any rights, or of revealing any business-sensitive information.\n\n4. In the case that an innovation is not complete, a company can report on their progress in developing the innovation. For example: “The company is currently developing Innovation ‘A’ and is at 60% completion.

Innovations may include things that have not existed before, or things that have been adapted, improved upon or modernized to improve work efficiency, enhance business competitiveness, and benefit society and the environment. However, companies should also demonstrate an innovation culture and disclose the ways in which they encourage employees to innovate and embed innovation into their work, or into products\/services to create added value for the organization.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key elements of its innovation development policy and guidelines, which show the company’s objectives and targets on innovation development in alignment with business direction and growth. This should also show a company’s internal processes for innovation development and promotion, such as innovation showcases, innovative thinking courses, etc. 2. Spending on R&D, innovation activities or innovation project plans over the past year. 3. Summary of benefits or outcomes from innovation development over the past year (if available). For example: “The company developed Innovation ‘A’, which successfully increased customer satisfaction while reducing energy costs by 10%, leading to a cost savings of 300,000 baht and a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous year.” Companies do not need to disclose confidential information so that they can minimize the risk of infringing on any rights, or of revealing any business-sensitive information.\n\n4. In the case that an innovation is not complete, a company can report on their progress in developing the innovation. For example: “The company is currently developing Innovation ‘A’ and is at 60% completion. Innovation A will be piloted next year for a full roll-out the following year.”\n\n83\n\nPerformance Summary: SET ESG Metrics\n\nEnvironmental Dimension\n\nGRI Standards\n\nUnit\n\nCode ESG Indicators E1 Environmental Policy and Compliance Standards Environmental E1.1C management policy and guidelines Number of cases or incidents of legal violations or negative environmental impacts, with explanation of mitigation measures Value of damages or fines received from legal violations or negative environmental impacts Compliance with international energy management principles and standards Compliance with international water management principles and standards Compliance with international waste management principles and standards Compliance with international greenhouse gas management or climate change principles and standards\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nNo. of cases\n\nE1.2C\n\nBaht\n\nE1.3R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.4R\n\nGRI 103\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.5R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.6R","83\n\nPerformance Summary: SET ESG Metrics\n\nEnvironmental Dimension\n\nGRI Standards\n\nUnit\n\nCode ESG Indicators E1 Environmental Policy and Compliance Standards Environmental E1.1C management policy and guidelines Number of cases or incidents of legal violations or negative environmental impacts, with explanation of mitigation measures Value of damages or fines received from legal violations or negative environmental impacts Compliance with international energy management principles and standards Compliance with international water management principles and standards Compliance with international waste management principles and standards Compliance with international greenhouse gas management or climate change principles and standards\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nNo. of cases\n\nE1.2C\n\nBaht\n\nE1.3R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.4R\n\nGRI 103\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.5R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.6R\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nE1.7R\n\nPrevious 3 years\n\nPrevious 2 years\n\nPrevious years\n\nReporting year\n\nE2 Energy Management E2.1C GRI E2.2C 302\n\nEnergy management plan Energy consumption \/fuel) (electricity\n\nYes\/ No kWh\n\n84\n\nCode\n\nGRI Standards\n\nESG Indicators\n\nRenewable energy consumption Energy management target Energy intensity\n\nE2.3C\n\nGRI 302\n\nE2.4R E2.5R E3 Water Management E3.1C E3.2C\n\nWater management plan Volume of water consumption Water use target\n\nE3.3R\n\nGRI 303\n\nWater intensity\n\nE3.4R\n\nPercentage of wastewater treated before discharge\n\nE3.5R E4 Waste Management E4.1C E4.2C E4.3R E4.4R E5 Greenhouse Gas Management Greenhouse gas E5.1C management plan Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions External verification of greenhouse gas emissions data Greenhouse gas reduction target Total greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Carbon intensity\n\nWaste management plan Volume of waste generated Waste management target Volume of waste that is reused and\/or recycled\n\nGRI 306\n\nE5.2C\n\nE5.3C\n\nGRI 305\n\nE5.4R\n\nE5.5R\n\nE5.6R\n\n85\n\nUnit kWh\n\nkWh kWh\/unit\n\nYes\/ No cubic meters cubic meters cubic meters\/ unit\n\nYes\/ No kilograms kilograms kilograms\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\ntCO 2e\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\ntCO 2e\n\ntCO 2e\n\ntCO 2e\/ unit\n\nPrevious 3 years\n\nPrevious 2 years\n\nPrevious years\n\nReporting year\n\nSocial Dimension\n\nGRI Code Standards S1 Human Rights S1.1C\n\nS1.2R\n\nS1.3R\n\nGRI 412\n\nESG Indicators\n\nHuman rights policy and guidelines Human rights due diligence ( ) and HRD protection measures Number of cases of human rights violations, and explanations of remediation and mitigation measures\n\nD\n\nUnit\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nNo. of cases\n\nPrevious 3 years\n\nPrevious 2 years\n\nPrevious years\n\nReporting year\n\nS2 Fair Labor Practices Employment S2.1C\n\nTotal number of employees\n\npeople\n\nEmployees by age group\n\ne a M\n\nl\n\ne a m e F\n\nl\n\ne a M\n\nl\n\ne a m e F\n\nl\n\ne a M\n\nl\n\ne a m e F\n\nl\n\ne a M\n\nl\n\ne a m e F\n\nl\n\nBelow 30 years old -

A sustainable supply chain management process considers environmental and social impacts and good governance, as this will help to mitigate business impacts from issues such as illegal labor and corruption. It also indicates that a company is committed to building relationships with its suppliers and to develop the business while delivering positive results for the economy, society and environment, for example through continuous supplier capacity development and green procurement.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key aspects of its sustainable supply chain management policy and guidelines, or the Supplier Code of Conduct (if applicable), to demonstrate that the company has criteria for procurement covering environmental, social, and good governance practices. Examples include environmentally-friendly procurement of raw materials, products and services, and the prohibition of child or slave labor.\n\n2.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","G3 Sustainability Risk Management G3.5R G3.1C Standards on sustainability risk Sustainability risk management policy and guidelines management G3.2C ESG risks and opportunities G3.3C Emerging risks G3.4C Business continuity plans (BCP)\n\n48\n\nCore (C) Indicators\n\nRecommended (R) Indicators\n\nG4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G4.1C Sustainable supply chain management policy and guidelines G4.2C Sustainable supply chain management plan\n\nG4.3R Percentage of new suppliers undergoing sustainability screening criteria G4.4R Supplier Code of Conduct G4.5R Percentage of suppliers acknowledging the Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nG5 Innovation Development G5.1C Innovation development policy and guidelines at the organization level G5.2C Process to develop and promote an innovation culture G5.3C Spending on innovation research & development\n\nG5.4R Benefits received from innovation development\n\nAdditional Recommendations\n\nIf a company carries out sustainable business activities in other areas beyond those listed above by The Stock Exchange of Thailand, the company can disclose additional policies, guidelines, plans, performance and indicators as relevant.

However, companies should also demonstrate an innovation culture and disclose the ways in which they encourage employees to innovate and embed innovation into their work, or into products\/services to create added value for the organization.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key elements of its innovation development policy and guidelines, which show the company’s objectives and targets on innovation development in alignment with business direction and growth. This should also show a company’s internal processes for innovation development and promotion, such as innovation showcases, innovative thinking courses, etc. 2.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

It also demonstrates a company’s commitment to reusing or recycling waste by bringing it back into business processes to create added value for the business.\n\nGreenhouse gas management This indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy and resource consumption across its value chain. These are significant contributors to the climate crisis and global warming, and will impact business operations in the future. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Brief overview of its environmental policy and guidelines, to show its approach to environmental management across the value chain. Policies may have similarities or differences from one another depending on the business context.\n\n2. Outcomes from the implementation of its environmental policy and guidelines, to ensure trust in how it manages energy and resources efficiently. In addition, a company should report on efforts to reduce its environmental impacts, as well as the number of incidents or cases of environmental incidents or violations, and explain the corrective measures taken (if any). 3. The value of fines or damages, in financial terms, resulting from environmental violations or incidents (if any), as well as the value of damages paid to individuals who were impacted by the company’s actions on the environment.\n\n4. How the company has applied environmental standards within its operational context in order to elevate the quality of environmental management. Note that some environmental standards, such as ISO 14001 and CDP, may be required for industries that have dealings with international markets and investments.\n\n5.

The purpose of this section is to provide practical guidance to companies who are looking to implement TCFD recommendations within their organization.\n\nThis report consolidates some examples of good practices, which are inspired by real-world use cases. These examples are used to illustrate how the TCFD recommendations are implemented and provide insights to companies to develop their own strategy and approach. The case studies and examples included in this report do not demonstrate the only approach to implementing the TCFD recommendations, but rather serve as examples to illustrate how they have been implemented in practice, which provides companies with a point of reference. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and companies should adapt the TCFD recommendations to their unique organizational context.\n\n| 3\n\nInterdependencies of the TCFD Pillars\n\nThe diagram below shows the interdependencies between all four TCFD pillars and highlights the importance of reporting. The TCFD pillars are governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\nA well-established governance structure can ensure that climate issues are addressed across the organization as a matter of priority and in an effective manner. It is a prerequisite to effectively identifying, assessing and managing a wide spectrum of climate issues, as well as formulating an ambitious and practical climate strategy.\n\nRisk management is too often seen as a compliance exercise and not truly integrated with business strategy, objectives and decision-making. To effectively address climate challenges, business strategy should take climate-related issues into consideration. Through the climate risk identification and assessment exercise, companies can identify climate risks that are material to their business and choose the appropriate risk response to address those issues. However, adopting a risk response that is not aligned with the business strategy is ineffective to address climate risks. Climate risk responses that are in line with overall business strategies can ensure all levels of the company are working together to achieve a common goal.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of climate reporting is often underestimated by companies. It is worthwhile to note that reporting is an important tool to communicate a company’s performance and actions against climate-related issues. By disclosing climate-related issues in a transparent way, companies can receive valuable feedback from their internal and external stakeholders, including investors, on how they can further improve their climate governance, strategy, and risk management. Companies can then evaluate their approach and strategy on climate-related issues and update their stakeholders on any significant changes, forming an effective feedback loop.\n\nStrategy\n\nFeedback\n\nGovernance\n\nReporting\n\nClimate risk management (metrics and targets)\n\nClimate risk identiﬁcation and assessment\n\nFeedback\n\n| 4\n\nTCFD Journey Roadmap - identify your stage in the environmental journey\n\nThe TCFD roadmap, which is shown in the table below, describes the characteristics of four different environmental stages, namely early, developing, mature and best practice, based on the four TCFD pillars.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","Sales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management. They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders.

In addition, if a company is able to assess climate-related risks and establish mitigation measures for such risks, it will be able to identify opportunities to integrate renewable energy into its business.\n\n4\n\nA greenhouse gas has the property of absorbing heat or infrared radiation, which helps to stabilize the Earth’s atmospheric temperature. However, if the volume of greenhouse gases becomes too high, this will cause the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to the current problem where greenhouse gases are significant contributors to negative environmental impacts and climate change. All sectors of society are therefore encouraging businesses to manage reductions in the seven greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen fluoride (NF3).\n\n4 ), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur\n\n57\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gases are emitted from different organizational activities, for example from electricity use in production processes or services, and fuel use in transportation. If a company is consistently emitting more greenhouse gas emissions but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this reveals an imbalance between its energy and resource requirements compared to its ability to generate profit. It also reveals the environmental impacts that a company causes from its operations. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

In addition, data on the number of employees can reveal whether an organization’s size and structure are appropriately suited to its needs. For example, reporting on the number of employees by age group shows that a company possesses experiences across different generations. However, if there are too many younger employees, the business may be lacking in experienced personnel, whereas if there are too many employees close to retirement, the business risks facing a labor shortage. This information is important for helping a company to prepare its human resources for the future. Furthermore, data on employees across different categories can demonstrate workforce diversity in terms of gender, age, roles and responsibilities and geographies, and this can help to foster opportunities for persons with disabilities\n\n5 and the elderly.6\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1.

Companies should communicate the impacts of their products and\/or services to customers, users or consumers in a complete and accurate way, so that these stakeholders can be confident that the company is using its marketing tools responsibly. This will help to reduce the risks of trade barriers and create opportunities for a company to build long-term consumer brand loyalty.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key summary of its marketing and sales guidelines, and performance against plans. These\n\nshould show that a company is aware of the impacts of its marketing communications tools on customers\/consumers, and that it does not support advertising or sales promotion activities that promote illegal or immoral conduct.\n\n2. Measures and outcomes of communicating about its products or services in a transparent and comprehensive way, to help consumers make decisions. A company may present information or warnings about the use of a product and\/or service through user manuals, product labels or packaging.

If the LTIFR number increases, this may lead to a reduction in business productivity or output, or business interruptions. Overall, the LTIFR is a beneficial indicator that companies can use for setting its safety development targets.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3.

In cases of consumer rights violations, companies should demonstrate that they have an approach for managing the complaint and have put in place mitigation measures for the affected consumers, ensuring that they are treated fairly.\n\nPromoting customer engagement This demonstrates a company’s ongoing commitment to responding to customers’ expectations and building relationships, which will help to build customers’ trust in the company’s products and services. Through this approach, companies can also retain customers and identify opportunities to build new customer bases. In addition, companies should assess customer satisfaction to understand whether customers accept their products and services; that their experiences match their expectations, and whether the company’s products\/services are effective, as all of this has an impact on business growth. Finally, companies should use the outcomes of their customer engagement to improve on their approach to customer relations and enhancing customer satisfaction.

A company may also face higher costs of hiring and developing new employees to replace those who have left.","S3.9R\n\nGRI 417\n\nPolicy on developing and engaging with communities\/societies affected b Plans to support the development and engagement of communities\/societies y the business affected b Number of conflicts with communities\/societies, and remediation measures Target for developing and engaging with communities\/societies affected b Benefits of development projects or activities to communities\/societies Total financial contribution to community development projects or activities\n\ny the business\n\nS4.2C\n\nS4.3C\n\nGRI 413\n\nS4.4R\n\ny the business\n\nS4.5R\n\nS4.6R\n\n\/social\n\nUnit\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nNo. of cases\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nBaht\n\nPrevious 3 years\n\nPrevious 2 years\n\nPrevious years\n\nReporting year\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension\n\nGRI Standards\n\nCode Unit G1 Policy, Structure and Governance System Board Composition G1.1C\n\nESG Indicators\n\nProfiles of individual directors Number of board members Number of independent directors Number of non-executive directors Number of female directors Independent chairman of the board Separation of the roles of chairman and CEO Number of independent directors in each sub -committee Independent chairman of -committee each sub Number of years of tenure for individual directors\n\nG1.2C\n\nG1.3C\n\nG1.4C\n\nG1.5C\n\nGRI 102-18\n\nG1.6C\n\nG1.7C\n\nG1.8C\n\nG1.9C\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nPeople\n\nPeople\n\nPeople\n\nPeople\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nPeople\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nPrevious 3 years\n\nPrevious 2 years\n\nPrevious years\n\nReporting year\n\nG1.10C\n\nYears\n\nBoard Roles and Responsibilities G1.11C\n\nNumber of board meetings Board performance Number of audit committee meetings Audit committee performance\n\nG1.12C G1.13C\n\nGRI 102-26\n\nG1.14C\n\nNo. of meetings Yes\/ No No. of meetings No Yes\/\n\n90\n\nCode\n\nGRI Standards\n\nESG Indicators\n\nG1.15C\n\nG1.16C\n\nG1.17R\n\nGRI 102-26\n\nNumber of sub committee meetings Performance of each -committee sub Succession plan implementation\n\nDirector Recruitment G1.18C\n\nPolicy and criteria for recruiting directors with qualifications that align with organizational strategy Analysis of directors’ skills and experience according to business needs ( board skill matrix) Profiles of newly appointed directors Director and Senior Executive Remuneration Policy and criteria for G1.21C director remuneration Director remuneration b y individual Other non-financial compensation for directors Policy and criteria for senior executive remuneration Total remuneration for senior executives Other compensation and long-term benefits for senior executives\n\nGRI 102-24\n\nG1.19C\n\nG1.20C\n\nG1.22C\n\nG1.23C\n\nGRI 102-38\n\nG1.24C\n\nG1.25C\n\nG1.26R\n\nDirector Development G1.27C\n\nG1.28R\n\nGRI 102-27\n\nDirector development policy Results of individual director development\n\n91\n\nUnit No. of meetings No Yes\/\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nBaht\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nBaht\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nPrevious 3 years\n\nPrevious 2 years\n\nPrevious years\n\nReporting year\n\nCode\n\nGRI Standards\n\nESG Indicators\n\nUnit\n\nPrevious 3 years\n\nPrevious 2 years\n\nPrevious years\n\nReporting year\n\nPerformance Evaluation of the Board of Directors and Senior Executives Criteria for evaluating G1.29C board performance Board performance results b y committee Board performance results y each sub -committee Individual director performance results Performance evaluation criteria for the managing director\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nG1.30C\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nG1.31C\n\nGRI 102-28\n\nb\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nG1.32R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nG1.33R\n\nBusiness Code of Conduct G1.34C G1.35C\n\nCode of conduct Anti-corruption policy and guidelines Number of code of conduct violations or incidents of corruption, and remediation measures Grievance and whistleblowing policy and guidelines Measures to prevent code G1.38R of conduct violations G2 Sustainability Policy and Strategy Sustainability policy and G2.1C targets at the organization level Material sustainability topics Sustainability report Sustainability performance disclosure standards, e.g. Standards\n\nG1.36C\n\nGRI 102-17\n\nG1.37C\n\nG2.2R\n\nGRI 102-55\n\nG2.3R G2.4R\n\nYes\/ Yes\/\n\nNo No\n\nNo. of cases\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nYes\/ Yes\/\n\nNo No\n\n, GRI\n\n92","3.

In addition, data on the number of employees can reveal whether an organization’s size and structure are appropriately suited to its needs. For example, reporting on the number of employees by age group shows that a company possesses experiences across different generations. However, if there are too many younger employees, the business may be lacking in experienced personnel, whereas if there are too many employees close to retirement, the business risks facing a labor shortage. This information is important for helping a company to prepare its human resources for the future. Furthermore, data on employees across different categories can demonstrate workforce diversity in terms of gender, age, roles and responsibilities and geographies, and this can help to foster opportunities for persons with disabilities\n\n5 and the elderly.6\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Number of employees in the past year, categorized by gender, age, and employment level (such\n\nas staff, management, and senior management).

If a company has organizational-level sustainability targets, this makes it more apparent that it has a defined direction and objectives to support its sustainability policy, and to measure and assess performance.\n\nMaterial topics Material topics are economic, social, and environmental topics that a company has determined to be important and urgent, and which affect its ability to do business. In addition, material topics reflect the issues that are important to both a company and its stakeholders. These topics can help a company to develop its business direction and strategy, and ensure that this aligns with stakeholders’ expectations within its operational context.\n\nSustainability report A document that contains information about a company’s environmental, social, and governance performance.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic.

They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process.

In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area.

Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","2.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

This will help to stimulate interest for readers, make content easier to memorize, and enhance communications efficiency.\n\n3.\n\n21\n\n04\n\nElements of Sustainability Reporting\n\n4.1 Part 1:\n\nEssential Information\n\nCompanies should provide an overview of their business operations, as this will help information users to understand their operational context and the business activities that affect stakeholders. Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions. Examples include pricing, advertisements, and announcements.\n\nCustomer Services Activities related to enhancing customer satisfaction after sales, to retain customers for the repeat purchases of products and services. Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","(2) Stakeholder expectations Companies should briefly explain the expectations and needs of each\n\nstakeholder group, for example:\n\nStakeholder Group Shareholders\n\nEmployees\n\nCustomers\n\nSuppliers\n\nCommunities\/Societies\n\nExpectations\/Needs Business transparency and regular returns on investment Fair compensation and career progression Good quality and appropriately priced products and services Fair and transparent procurement practices Protection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\n27\n\nWhen reporting on stakeholder expectations, companies should show how their business activities are linked to each stakeholder group. Stakeholders’ expectations should be assessed and analy zed at least once a year through engagement channels such as participatory hearing processes, satisfaction surveys, meetings, or other channels. Companies should use the results from these processes to develop appropriate methods of engagement to minimize risks of conflicts or sanctions against the business, such as boycotts on sales and purchases, sales of company shares, employee resignations, or protests.\n\n(3) Responding to stakeholder expectations Companies should summarize the primary methods, activities, projects,\n\nand communication channels that they use to engage with different stakeholders, such as opinion and satisfaction surveys and seminars.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach.

This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).","20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.\n\nPresentation techniques Companies should present quantitative and qualitative information using language that is concise and easy to understand, and use formats such as infographics, diagrams, tables, and images in an organized way. This will help to stimulate interest for readers, make content easier to memorize, and enhance communications efficiency.\n\n3.\n\n21\n\n04\n\nElements of Sustainability Reporting\n\n4.1 Part 1:\n\nEssential Information\n\nCompanies should provide an overview of their business operations, as this will help information users to understand their operational context and the business activities that affect stakeholders. Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions. Examples include pricing, advertisements, and announcements.\n\nCustomer Services Activities related to enhancing customer satisfaction after sales, to retain customers for the repeat purchases of products and services. Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) - CDP (previously Carbon Disclosure Project) - SDG Compass: The guide for business action on the SDGs - WFE ESG Guidance and Metrics by the World Federation of Exchanges - Model Guidance on Reporting ESG Information to Investors by the UN Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Initiative\n\n13\n\nMeasuring Stakeholder Capitalism: Towards Common Metrics and y the World Economic )\n\nOther sustainability reporting guidelines prepared b markets\n\nOther sustainability reporting guidelines prepared b markets\n\n2.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2.

They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.","35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic. These should align with the objectives and targets that they have set for that material topic and include the following:\n\n4.3.2\n\n(1) Resource allocation, e.g., who is the responsible owner, the equipment,\n\ntools, machinery, and capital used;\n\n(2) Protection and remediation measures in cases of problems or obstacles;\n\nand\n\n(3) How it is engaging relevant stakeholders.\n\nIndicators and Performance Companies should report performance that is measurable, and evaluate their performance on each material topic using clear performance indicators. This will enable companies to see their progress against targets and ensure that their sustainability journeys are effective and ongoing.\n\n4.3.3\n\n36\n\nTable 4: Example of how to report a management approach for a material topic\n\nMaterial Topic\n\nObjectives and Targets\n\nEnergy Management ’s energy consumption to ensure highest efficiency\n\nManage the company Consider efficient natural resource use, reduce environmental impacts and energy costs.\n\nThe company\n\n’s 2020 target is to reduce energy intensity per product b y , or maintain the energy consumption index at 814 M\n\n2% compared to 2019 less than or equal to 2.\n\nJ per product.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nComply with rules and regulations, and establish an ISO 50001 energy management system working group to implement the company .

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1.

Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","G3 Sustainability Risk Management G3.5R G3.1C Standards on sustainability risk Sustainability risk management policy and guidelines management G3.2C ESG risks and opportunities G3.3C Emerging risks G3.4C Business continuity plans (BCP)\n\n48\n\nCore (C) Indicators\n\nRecommended (R) Indicators\n\nG4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G4.1C Sustainable supply chain management policy and guidelines G4.2C Sustainable supply chain management plan\n\nG4.3R Percentage of new suppliers undergoing sustainability screening criteria G4.4R Supplier Code of Conduct G4.5R Percentage of suppliers acknowledging the Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nG5 Innovation Development G5.1C Innovation development policy and guidelines at the organization level G5.2C Process to develop and promote an innovation culture G5.3C Spending on innovation research & development\n\nG5.4R Benefits received from innovation development\n\nAdditional Recommendations\n\nIf a company carries out sustainable business activities in other areas beyond those listed above by The Stock Exchange of Thailand, the company can disclose additional policies, guidelines, plans, performance and indicators as relevant.

It also demonstrates a company’s readiness to handle risks concerning future energy crises, and how it identifies new business opportunities from renewable energy.\n\n52\n\nThis indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing water shortage risks and preventing negative environmental impacts from water use, including through community water resources conservation and restoration. Waste management\n\nWater management\n\nThis indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing negative environmental impacts through resource use efficiency. It also demonstrates a company’s commitment to reusing or recycling waste by bringing it back into business processes to create added value for the business.\n\nGreenhouse gas management This indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy and resource consumption across its value chain. These are significant contributors to the climate crisis and global warming, and will impact business operations in the future. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Brief overview of its environmental policy and guidelines, to show its approach to environmental management across the value chain. Policies may have similarities or differences from one another depending on the business context.","3. Results from monitoring, reviewing, and implementing its human rights policy and guidelines over the past year.\n\n4. Number of incidents relating to human rights violations, reported for all relevant stakeholder groups including staff and employees, workers of the company, suppliers, customers, communities and societies.

In addition, data on the number of employees can reveal whether an organization’s size and structure are appropriately suited to its needs. For example, reporting on the number of employees by age group shows that a company possesses experiences across different generations. However, if there are too many younger employees, the business may be lacking in experienced personnel, whereas if there are too many employees close to retirement, the business risks facing a labor shortage. This information is important for helping a company to prepare its human resources for the future. Furthermore, data on employees across different categories can demonstrate workforce diversity in terms of gender, age, roles and responsibilities and geographies, and this can help to foster opportunities for persons with disabilities\n\n5 and the elderly.6\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Number of employees in the past year, categorized by gender, age, and employment level (such\n\nas staff, management, and senior management). Example:\n\nAge\n\nStaff level\n\nFemale\n\nMale\n\nManagement level Male Female\n\nSenior management level\n\nFemale\n\nMale\n\nBelow 30 years old 30-50 years old Over 50 years old Total\n\n5 ‘Persons with disabilities’ refers to individuals who have limitations in their ability to conduct daily activities or to participate in society due to impairments in their sight, hearing, movement, communications, feeling and emotion, behaviors, mental capacity and learning, or other forms of impairment, as well as limitations in other areas, and require special support. (Source: Persons with Disabilities Empowerment Act, B.E. 2550). 6 ‘Elderly’ refers to a person, male or female, who is over 60 years of age, counting from their birth (Source: United Nations)\n\n60\n\n2.

Innovations may include things that have not existed before, or things that have been adapted, improved upon or modernized to improve work efficiency, enhance business competitiveness, and benefit society and the environment. However, companies should also demonstrate an innovation culture and disclose the ways in which they encourage employees to innovate and embed innovation into their work, or into products\/services to create added value for the organization.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key elements of its innovation development policy and guidelines, which show the company’s objectives and targets on innovation development in alignment with business direction and growth. This should also show a company’s internal processes for innovation development and promotion, such as innovation showcases, innovative thinking courses, etc. 2. Spending on R&D, innovation activities or innovation project plans over the past year. 3. Summary of benefits or outcomes from innovation development over the past year (if available). For example: “The company developed Innovation ‘A’, which successfully increased customer satisfaction while reducing energy costs by 10%, leading to a cost savings of 300,000 baht and a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous year.” Companies do not need to disclose confidential information so that they can minimize the risk of infringing on any rights, or of revealing any business-sensitive information.\n\n4. In the case that an innovation is not complete, a company can report on their progress in developing the innovation. For example: “The company is currently developing Innovation ‘A’ and is at 60% completion. Innovation A will be piloted next year for a full roll-out the following year.”\n\n83\n\nPerformance Summary: SET ESG Metrics\n\nEnvironmental Dimension\n\nGRI Standards\n\nUnit\n\nCode ESG Indicators E1 Environmental Policy and Compliance Standards Environmental E1.1C management policy and guidelines Number of cases or incidents of legal violations or negative environmental impacts, with explanation of mitigation measures Value of damages or fines received from legal violations or negative environmental impacts Compliance with international energy management principles and standards Compliance with international water management principles and standards Compliance with international waste management principles and standards Compliance with international greenhouse gas management or climate change principles and standards\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nNo. of cases\n\nE1.2C\n\nBaht\n\nE1.3R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.4R\n\nGRI 103\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.5R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.6R","2.

A sustainable supply chain management process considers environmental and social impacts and good governance, as this will help to mitigate business impacts from issues such as illegal labor and corruption. It also indicates that a company is committed to building relationships with its suppliers and to develop the business while delivering positive results for the economy, society and environment, for example through continuous supplier capacity development and green procurement.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key aspects of its sustainable supply chain management policy and guidelines, or the Supplier Code of Conduct (if applicable), to demonstrate that the company has criteria for procurement covering environmental, social, and good governance practices.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business.

Risk assessment and prioritization\n\nCommon risk assessment and prioritization approaches\n\n1. Set the criteria for climate risk assessment\n\nCompanies shall develop a set of assessment criteria and scales to assess climate risks. Well- established assessment criteria and scales can facilitate the analysis of climate risks and the risk prioritization process. Common criteria used for risk assessment include likelihood, magnitude of impact, adaptability and recovery.\n\nA rating scale can be applied to each criterion, which enables quantitative comparisons of the climate risks. For example, likelihood can be divided into five different categories: rare (1), unlikely (2), possible (3), likely (4), and very likely (5). Each category is assigned a score. The number in the bracket represents the score. The higher the score, the more significant the risk. A well-defined rating scale is essential for consistent interpretation of the materiality of the climate risks identified.\n\nCommon criteria used for risk assessment\n\nCriteria\n\nDescription\n\nExample of a rating scale\n\nLikelihood\n\nProbability of the impact on your business occurring within a specific time horizon\n\nRare (1), unlikely (2), possible (3), likely (4), very likely (5)\n\nMagnitude of impact\n\nMagnitude describes the extent to which the impact, if it occurred, would affect your business\n\nInsignificant (1), minor (2), moderate (3), major (4), significant (5)\n\nAdaptability\n\nCapacity of an entity to adapt and respond to risks\n\nVery low (1), low (2), medium (3), high (4), very high (5)\n\nRecovery\n\nCapacity of an entity to return to tolerance\n\nVery slow (1), slow (2), medium (3), fast (4), very fast (5)\n\n| 19\n\n2. Select appropriate approaches and tools to support the climate risk assessment\n\nThe climate risk identification process lays the foundation to conduct further detailed analysis and assessment of the climate risks. Companies shall identify the approaches and tools available for climate risk assessment and understand their strengths and weaknesses. After selecting the appropriate approaches and tools, companies can make use of them to assess and rate the risks in the climate risk inventory based on defined assessment criteria and scale.\n\nCommon approaches or tools for risk assessment\n\nApproaches\/ Tools for risk assessment\n\nDescription\n\nExpert input\n\nHarness the experience and knowledge of internal or external subject-matter professionals in assessing the risks\n\nScenario analysis\n\nAddress the potential implications of a range of long-term future states for risks under conditions of uncertainty\n\nForecasting and valuation\n\nLeverage historical data to estimate the potential impacts of risks on revenues, costs or profit\n\nClimate-specific tools\n\nUse tools for quantifying climate risks such as WBCSD Water Tool, WRI Aqueduct, etc\n\nPrimary data","Common approaches or tools for risk assessment\n\nApproaches\/ Tools for risk assessment\n\nDescription\n\nExpert input\n\nHarness the experience and knowledge of internal or external subject-matter professionals in assessing the risks\n\nScenario analysis\n\nAddress the potential implications of a range of long-term future states for risks under conditions of uncertainty\n\nForecasting and valuation\n\nLeverage historical data to estimate the potential impacts of risks on revenues, costs or profit\n\nClimate-specific tools\n\nUse tools for quantifying climate risks such as WBCSD Water Tool, WRI Aqueduct, etc\n\nPrimary data\n\nUse data from internal departments, survey results, interviews or focus groups as input into risk assessment\n\nSecondary data\n\nUse data from academic research, government or think tank data, industry or peer organization data or reports, existing analysis, etc as input into risk assessment\n\n| 20\n\n3. Analyse the climate risk assessment result and prioritize risks\n\nBased on the result of the climate risk assessment, a risk matrix can be constructed to visualize and analyse the materiality of all the climate risks, determining the priority of risks. Companies can determine the x-axis and y-axis of a risk matrix according to their own set of assessment criteria and scales.\n\nThe example of a risk matrix below shows a two-dimensional graph plotting vulnerability against hazard exposure. Hazard exposure refers to a company that is in a vulnerable setting or position while vulnerability is related to notions of resilience, flexibility and adaption. It refers to the propensity or predisposition of a company to suffer adversely from its exposure to hazards. Another example of a risk matrix can be a two- dimensional graph, in which the x-axis denotes impact, and the y-axis denotes likelihood.\n\nExample of a risk matrix\n\nVery high 5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nHigh 4\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\ne r u s o p x e d r a z a H\n\nModerate 3\n\nLow 2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n\n9\n\n6\n\n12\n\n8\n\n15\n\n10\n\nVery low 1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nVery low 1\n\nLow 2\n\nModerate 3\n\nHigh 4\n\nVery high 5\n\nVulnerability\n\nCategory 1\n\nRisks with very high materiality\n\nCategory 2\n\nRisks with high materiality\n\nCategory 3\n\nRisks with low materiality\n\nCategory 4\n\nRisks with very low materiality\n\nCompanies can categorize the risks based on their overall score and assign different levels of materiality to each category of risk. The example of a risk matrix above shows that the overall score of a risk is calculated by multiplying the hazard exposure rating by the vulnerability rating. For example, a risk gets four scores in hazard exposure and five scores in vulnerability. Its overall score is 20, which is multiplying four by five. Companies should develop their own calculation methodology and define different levels of materiality and its criteria. A risk matrix can be used to identify risks with different materiality levels and facilitate the risk prioritization process. With limited resources, companies may decide to prioritize addressing risks with high to highest materiality.\n\n| 21\n\nCase study – Climate Risk Assessment and Prioritization\n\nThe risks in the climate risk inventory are assessed by Company X’s expert team in terms\n\nof likelihood, time horizon, financial impact and response to risk.

An effective risk response implementation plan should be incorporated into business strategy at the company level. For example, a company considers achieving net-zero by 2050 as a risk response to climate risks. This overarching target should be supported and incorporated into the overall business strategy, which would involve actions and support from different levels of the company. Metrics should be developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan ahead of the execution stage.\n\nExecute the plan and monitor its effectiveness\n\nA designated team with well-defined responsibilities should execute the plan according to the timeline, report progress to management and monitor the effectiveness of the plan on a regular basis.

Reporting on TCFD recommendations Guidance on Climate Disclosures","The report then highlights and expands on three key areas of TCFD implementation, namely governance, climate scenario analysis and climate risk management. The purpose of this section is to provide practical guidance to companies who are looking to implement TCFD recommendations within their organization.\n\nThis report consolidates some examples of good practices, which are inspired by real-world use cases. These examples are used to illustrate how the TCFD recommendations are implemented and provide insights to companies to develop their own strategy and approach. The case studies and examples included in this report do not demonstrate the only approach to implementing the TCFD recommendations, but rather serve as examples to illustrate how they have been implemented in practice, which provides companies with a point of reference. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and companies should adapt the TCFD recommendations to their unique organizational context.\n\n| 3\n\nInterdependencies of the TCFD Pillars\n\nThe diagram below shows the interdependencies between all four TCFD pillars and highlights the importance of reporting. The TCFD pillars are governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\nA well-established governance structure can ensure that climate issues are addressed across the organization as a matter of priority and in an effective manner. It is a prerequisite to effectively identifying, assessing and managing a wide spectrum of climate issues, as well as formulating an ambitious and practical climate strategy.\n\nRisk management is too often seen as a compliance exercise and not truly integrated with business strategy, objectives and decision-making. To effectively address climate challenges, business strategy should take climate-related issues into consideration. Through the climate risk identification and assessment exercise, companies can identify climate risks that are material to their business and choose the appropriate risk response to address those issues. However, adopting a risk response that is not aligned with the business strategy is ineffective to address climate risks. Climate risk responses that are in line with overall business strategies can ensure all levels of the company are working together to achieve a common goal.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of climate reporting is often underestimated by companies. It is worthwhile to note that reporting is an important tool to communicate a company’s performance and actions against climate-related issues. By disclosing climate-related issues in a transparent way, companies can receive valuable feedback from their internal and external stakeholders, including investors, on how they can further improve their climate governance, strategy, and risk management. Companies can then evaluate their approach and strategy on climate-related issues and update their stakeholders on any significant changes, forming an effective feedback loop.\n\nStrategy\n\nFeedback\n\nGovernance\n\nReporting\n\nClimate risk management (metrics and targets)\n\nClimate risk identiﬁcation and assessment\n\nFeedback\n\n| 4\n\nTCFD Journey Roadmap - identify your stage in the environmental journey\n\nThe TCFD roadmap, which is shown in the table below, describes the characteristics of four different environmental stages, namely early, developing, mature and best practice, based on the four TCFD pillars.

These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.","Conflicts with communities This describes a company’s ability to build relationships with communities and comply with relevant laws, such as those relating to community rights, human rights, and the environment. Furthermore, it demonstrates whether a company effectively handles community grievances to within manageable levels and prevents incidents from deteriorating to the extent that they interrupt business operations, or stop projects entirely. If a company has an increasing number of community conflicts or worsening trends, this reflects the possibility that its business capabilities will decrease, and that it could face higher costs associated with conflict mitigation and resolution.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key information on its community\/social policy, which demonstrates a commitment and\n\nresponsibility to protecting and reducing the impacts of its business operations on communities\/ societies, as well as guidelines or mitigation measures to address community\/social impacts. Note that this information could also be part of a company’s human rights policy and guidelines. 2. Target for developing and engaging with communities that may be affected by the business. Companies should disclose quantitative, comparable and measurable targets, for example, a reduction in the number of complaints or conflicts with communities that are caused by business activities or operations.\n\n3. Community\/social development plans that align with the company’s business context, such as:\n\nCommunity satisfaction surveys, used for developing approaches that respond to the needs of both the community and business.\n\nAnalysis of benefits that the community and company receive from community development efforts, or projects that address social issues.\n\nSupporting sustainable, self-sufficient communities by using business resources, capabilities and capacities to strengthen and elevate their qualities of life.\n\n4. Benefits from community\/social development projects or activities. This is to demonstrate the outcomes and effectiveness of a company’s community development plans. A company can disclose these benefits in financial terms, such as increased income per household, or non- financial terms, such as increase in the number of local suppliers.\n\n5. In the case that a company has conflicts with communities, it should report on the number of grievances and impacts that have occurred, as well as the mitigation and resolution measures adopted.\n\n6. Spending on projects and activities for community\/social development and assistance. This will reveal how suitable a company’s plans are and whether they are reflective of the benefits, value, and impact that the projects and activities deliver.\n\n69\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension\n\nCore (C) Indicators\n\nRecommended (R) Indicators\n\nGRI Standards\n\nSDGs\n\nG1 Policy, Structure and Governance System Board Composition G1.1C Profiles of individual directors\n\nG1.2C Number of board members\n\nG1.3C Number of independent directors\n\nGRI 102-18 Governance Structure\n\n:\n\nGoal 5: Gender Equality Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\n\nG1.4C Number of non-executive directors\n\nG1.5C Number of female directors\n\nG1.6C Independent chairman of the board\n\nG1.7C Separation of the roles of chairman and CEO\n\nG1.8C Number of independent directors in each sub-committee G1.9C Independent chairman of each sub-committee G1.10C Number of years of tenure for individual directors\n\n70\n\nRationale • Board composition Board composition is essential for demonstrating that a company’s governance structure is transparent and independent. Companies should have an appropriately sufficient number of directors for their business needs, and should consider a diverse range of director qualifications to ensure that different viewpoints are captured for the benefit of the business. In particular, companies should encourage a higher number of female directors to support equal gender rights within their businesses.","Social Dimension\n\nIndicators covering a company’s social policies, plans, and performance.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic.

In cases of consumer rights violations, companies should demonstrate that they have an approach for managing the complaint and have put in place mitigation measures for the affected consumers, ensuring that they are treated fairly.\n\nPromoting customer engagement This demonstrates a company’s ongoing commitment to responding to customers’ expectations and building relationships, which will help to build customers’ trust in the company’s products and services. Through this approach, companies can also retain customers and identify opportunities to build new customer bases. In addition, companies should assess customer satisfaction to understand whether customers accept their products and services; that their experiences match their expectations, and whether the company’s products\/services are effective, as all of this has an impact on business growth. Finally, companies should use the outcomes of their customer engagement to improve on their approach to customer relations and enhancing customer satisfaction. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Brief summary of policy and guidelines on consumer data protection, the number of consumer data breaches (if any), and remediation measures that show how the company is complying with the aforementioned policy.\n\n2. Grievance management approach for consumer data breaches and\/or consumer rights violations.

Companies should communicate the impacts of their products and\/or services to customers, users or consumers in a complete and accurate way, so that these stakeholders can be confident that the company is using its marketing tools responsibly. This will help to reduce the risks of trade barriers and create opportunities for a company to build long-term consumer brand loyalty.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key summary of its marketing and sales guidelines, and performance against plans. These\n\nshould show that a company is aware of the impacts of its marketing communications tools on customers\/consumers, and that it does not support advertising or sales promotion activities that promote illegal or immoral conduct.\n\n2. Measures and outcomes of communicating about its products or services in a transparent and comprehensive way, to help consumers make decisions. A company may present information or warnings about the use of a product and\/or service through user manuals, product labels or packaging.

It consists of two levels of indicators:\n\n1. Core (C) Indicators","18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights\n\nS2 Fair Labor Practices S3 Responsibility to Customers\/Consumers S4 Responsibility to Communities\/Societies\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension (G) G1 Policy, Structure and Governance System\n\nG2 Sustainability Policy and Strategy G3 Sustainability Risk Management G4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G5 Innovation Development\n\nExplanation\n\nBusiness activities can impact the qualities of life and human rights of many groups of stakeholders. To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic.

The use of renewable energy reflects a company’s commitment to reducing its reliance on non-renewable, fossil fuel-based energy, which will help to reduce the risk of future energy shortages and the volume of greenhouse gases emitted from its business processes. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and quantitative targets to reduce electricity and\/or fuel consumption,\n\ndemonstrating its commitment to improving energy use efficiency, reducing energy waste, and continuously improving its effectiveness in managing energy requirements.\n\n2. The volume of electricity and fuel consumption for all of its business activities, for example production, services and logistics. Companies should report electricity consumption in kWh, and other fuel consumption according to their respective units, for example, fuel oil in liters (l), crude oil in barrels (bbl), natural gas in kilograms (kg), and coal in tons (t). Note that the unit of energy consumption may change depending on the size and type of the business. 3. Energy intensity, reported as the ratio of energy consumption to financial output, business size or activity, e.g., unit of production (product\/service), area, or revenue. This indicator reveals whether a company uses energy effectively and efficiently compared to its expansion or growth. In addition, energy intensity reveals an organization’s ability to manage reductions in energy consumption.\n\n54\n\n4. If a company is using renewable energy, this should be reported clearly by energy type, for example solar energy, hydropower, wind energy, waste-to-energy, and biogas, etc.\n\n5.

Information about how a company uses water from the municipal water supply and natural sources, such as surface water and ground water, can reveal trends in its water use each year. If a company is consistently using more water, but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this indicates that it is using water in a wasteful manner and that there are potentially higher water management costs from having to maintain associated infrastructure such as water distribution systems, pipeline systems, and wastewater treatment systems. Wastewater treatment before discharge\n\nWater management\n\nThis shows how a company is preventing environmental pollution by effectively reducing contaminants in wastewater to as low levels as possible before discharging it into public waterways. If the information shows that wastewater is treated to a quality below the minimum required standard, this may lead to risks of environmental law violations or conflicts with communities.\n\n55\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1.

They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.","2.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2.

The use of renewable energy reflects a company’s commitment to reducing its reliance on non-renewable, fossil fuel-based energy, which will help to reduce the risk of future energy shortages and the volume of greenhouse gases emitted from its business processes. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and quantitative targets to reduce electricity and\/or fuel consumption,\n\ndemonstrating its commitment to improving energy use efficiency, reducing energy waste, and continuously improving its effectiveness in managing energy requirements.\n\n2. The volume of electricity and fuel consumption for all of its business activities, for example production, services and logistics. Companies should report electricity consumption in kWh, and other fuel consumption according to their respective units, for example, fuel oil in liters (l), crude oil in barrels (bbl), natural gas in kilograms (kg), and coal in tons (t). Note that the unit of energy consumption may change depending on the size and type of the business. 3. Energy intensity, reported as the ratio of energy consumption to financial output, business size or activity, e.g., unit of production (product\/service), area, or revenue. This indicator reveals whether a company uses energy effectively and efficiently compared to its expansion or growth. In addition, energy intensity reveals an organization’s ability to manage reductions in energy consumption.\n\n54\n\n4. If a company is using renewable energy, this should be reported clearly by energy type, for example solar energy, hydropower, wind energy, waste-to-energy, and biogas, etc.\n\n5.

Information about how a company uses water from the municipal water supply and natural sources, such as surface water and ground water, can reveal trends in its water use each year. If a company is consistently using more water, but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this indicates that it is using water in a wasteful manner and that there are potentially higher water management costs from having to maintain associated infrastructure such as water distribution systems, pipeline systems, and wastewater treatment systems. Wastewater treatment before discharge\n\nWater management\n\nThis shows how a company is preventing environmental pollution by effectively reducing contaminants in wastewater to as low levels as possible before discharging it into public waterways.

Analyse the climate risk assessment result and prioritize risks\n\nBased on the result of the climate risk assessment, a risk matrix can be constructed to visualize and analyse the materiality of all the climate risks, determining the priority of risks. Companies can determine the x-axis and y-axis of a risk matrix according to their own set of assessment criteria and scales.\n\nThe example of a risk matrix below shows a two-dimensional graph plotting vulnerability against hazard exposure. Hazard exposure refers to a company that is in a vulnerable setting or position while vulnerability is related to notions of resilience, flexibility and adaption. It refers to the propensity or predisposition of a company to suffer adversely from its exposure to hazards. Another example of a risk matrix can be a two- dimensional graph, in which the x-axis denotes impact, and the y-axis denotes likelihood.\n\nExample of a risk matrix\n\nVery high 5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nHigh 4\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\ne r u s o p x e d r a z a H\n\nModerate 3\n\nLow 2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n\n9\n\n6\n\n12\n\n8\n\n15\n\n10\n\nVery low 1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nVery low 1\n\nLow 2\n\nModerate 3\n\nHigh 4\n\nVery high 5\n\nVulnerability\n\nCategory 1\n\nRisks with very high materiality\n\nCategory 2\n\nRisks with high materiality\n\nCategory 3\n\nRisks with low materiality\n\nCategory 4\n\nRisks with very low materiality\n\nCompanies can categorize the risks based on their overall score and assign different levels of materiality to each category of risk. The example of a risk matrix above shows that the overall score of a risk is calculated by multiplying the hazard exposure rating by the vulnerability rating. For example, a risk gets four scores in hazard exposure and five scores in vulnerability. Its overall score is 20, which is multiplying four by five. Companies should develop their own calculation methodology and define different levels of materiality and its criteria. A risk matrix can be used to identify risks with different materiality levels and facilitate the risk prioritization process. With limited resources, companies may decide to prioritize addressing risks with high to highest materiality.\n\n| 21\n\nCase study – Climate Risk Assessment and Prioritization\n\nThe risks in the climate risk inventory are assessed by Company X’s expert team in terms\n\nof likelihood, time horizon, financial impact and response to risk. Company X has its own\n\ndefinition of time horizon. Short-term is defined as less than one year. Mid-term is defined as\n\nmore than one year but less than three years. Long-term is defined as three to nine years.\n\nCompany X forms an expert team, which includes representatives from different teams\n\nsuch as Sustainability, Procurement, Finance, Operations, Marketing and an external\n\nexpert on climate issues. The expert team is responsible for identifying climate risks and\n\nassessing the risks. A primary screening is conducted to remove risks that fall behind the\n\nlong-term time horizon, or that fall within the time horizon but are below the financial\n\nmateriality threshold of US$50 million.\n\nThe primary screening results of the assessment are shared with C-suite executives and","research study and stakeholder engagement. Peer review is conducted by reviewing the\n\npublications of peer companies such as their sustainability report and CDP response. This\n\nallows the team to understand what climate risks identified by peers are missing from the\n\ncurrent climate risk inventory. The team also studies the latest reports published by well-\n\nrecognized organizations such as the Global Risks Report published annually by the World\n\nEconomic Forum and publications released by industry associations, to understand the\n\nlatest global and industry-specific challenges. Through internal and external stakeholder\n\nengagement, the team can keep abreast of the latest climate-related regulations, and\n\nemerging climate-related risks resulting from their suppliers or internal operation, etc.\n\nThe team reviews the current climate risk inventory by the three major methods indicated\n\nabove on an annual basis and revises the climate risk inventory appropriately. For instance,\n\nwhen potential new climate risks have been identified, the team will identify the potential\n\nrelevance for the company and decide whether to include them in the climate risk inventory.\n\n| 18\n\nB. Risk assessment and prioritization\n\nCommon risk assessment and prioritization approaches\n\n1. Set the criteria for climate risk assessment\n\nCompanies shall develop a set of assessment criteria and scales to assess climate risks. Well- established assessment criteria and scales can facilitate the analysis of climate risks and the risk prioritization process. Common criteria used for risk assessment include likelihood, magnitude of impact, adaptability and recovery.\n\nA rating scale can be applied to each criterion, which enables quantitative comparisons of the climate risks. For example, likelihood can be divided into five different categories: rare (1), unlikely (2), possible (3), likely (4), and very likely (5). Each category is assigned a score. The number in the bracket represents the score. The higher the score, the more significant the risk. A well-defined rating scale is essential for consistent interpretation of the materiality of the climate risks identified.\n\nCommon criteria used for risk assessment\n\nCriteria\n\nDescription\n\nExample of a rating scale\n\nLikelihood\n\nProbability of the impact on your business occurring within a specific time horizon\n\nRare (1), unlikely (2), possible (3), likely (4), very likely (5)\n\nMagnitude of impact\n\nMagnitude describes the extent to which the impact, if it occurred, would affect your business\n\nInsignificant (1), minor (2), moderate (3), major (4), significant (5)\n\nAdaptability\n\nCapacity of an entity to adapt and respond to risks\n\nVery low (1), low (2), medium (3), high (4), very high (5)\n\nRecovery\n\nCapacity of an entity to return to tolerance\n\nVery slow (1), slow (2), medium (3), fast (4), very fast (5)\n\n| 19\n\n2.

Risk identification\n\nCommon types of climate risks\n\nClimate-related risk1 refers to the potential negative impacts of climate change on an organization. They are divided into two major categories: physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks are associated with the physical impacts of climate change, while transition risks are related to the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nBelow are the lists of physical and transition risks suggested in the TCFD recommendations.\n\nPhysical risks\n\nPhysical risks from climate change can be event-based (acute) or longer-term climate pattern shifts (chronic). Physical risks can have direct financial implications for organizations such as direct damage to assets, and indirect impacts including supply chain disruption.\n\nAcute risks\n\nIncreased severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods\n\nChronic risks\n\nChanges in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns • Rising mean temperatures • Rising sea levels\n\nTransition risks\n\nThe road to a low-carbon economy will involve addressing the mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. This is likely to materialize in the form of extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes.\n\nPolicy and legal risks\n\nIncreased carbon pricing • Enhanced emissions reporting obligations • Mandatory regulation of existing products and services • Exposure to litigation\n\nTechnology risks\n\nSubstitution of existing products and services with lower emissions options • Unsuccessful investment in new technologies • Costs to transition to lower emissions technology\n\nMarket risks\n\nChanging customer behavior • Uncertainty in market signals • Increased cost of raw materials\n\nReputation risks\n\nShifts in consumer preferences • Stigmatisation of industry sector • Increased stakeholder concern or negative stakeholder feedback\n\n| 16\n\nCommon approach for climate risk identification\n\n1\n\nUnderstand the internal and external environment\n\n{\tAdopt different approaches to understand the internal and external environment and","The report then highlights and expands on three key areas of TCFD implementation, namely governance, climate scenario analysis and climate risk management. The purpose of this section is to provide practical guidance to companies who are looking to implement TCFD recommendations within their organization.\n\nThis report consolidates some examples of good practices, which are inspired by real-world use cases. These examples are used to illustrate how the TCFD recommendations are implemented and provide insights to companies to develop their own strategy and approach. The case studies and examples included in this report do not demonstrate the only approach to implementing the TCFD recommendations, but rather serve as examples to illustrate how they have been implemented in practice, which provides companies with a point of reference. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and companies should adapt the TCFD recommendations to their unique organizational context.\n\n| 3\n\nInterdependencies of the TCFD Pillars\n\nThe diagram below shows the interdependencies between all four TCFD pillars and highlights the importance of reporting. The TCFD pillars are governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\nA well-established governance structure can ensure that climate issues are addressed across the organization as a matter of priority and in an effective manner. It is a prerequisite to effectively identifying, assessing and managing a wide spectrum of climate issues, as well as formulating an ambitious and practical climate strategy.\n\nRisk management is too often seen as a compliance exercise and not truly integrated with business strategy, objectives and decision-making. To effectively address climate challenges, business strategy should take climate-related issues into consideration. Through the climate risk identification and assessment exercise, companies can identify climate risks that are material to their business and choose the appropriate risk response to address those issues. However, adopting a risk response that is not aligned with the business strategy is ineffective to address climate risks. Climate risk responses that are in line with overall business strategies can ensure all levels of the company are working together to achieve a common goal.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of climate reporting is often underestimated by companies. It is worthwhile to note that reporting is an important tool to communicate a company’s performance and actions against climate-related issues. By disclosing climate-related issues in a transparent way, companies can receive valuable feedback from their internal and external stakeholders, including investors, on how they can further improve their climate governance, strategy, and risk management. Companies can then evaluate their approach and strategy on climate-related issues and update their stakeholders on any significant changes, forming an effective feedback loop.\n\nStrategy\n\nFeedback\n\nGovernance\n\nReporting\n\nClimate risk management (metrics and targets)\n\nClimate risk identiﬁcation and assessment\n\nFeedback\n\n| 4\n\nTCFD Journey Roadmap - identify your stage in the environmental journey\n\nThe TCFD roadmap, which is shown in the table below, describes the characteristics of four different environmental stages, namely early, developing, mature and best practice, based on the four TCFD pillars.

For example, reporting on the number of employees by age group shows that a company possesses experiences across different generations. However, if there are too many younger employees, the business may be lacking in experienced personnel, whereas if there are too many employees close to retirement, the business risks facing a labor shortage.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies to disclose information concerning their environmental, social, and governance performance across their entire business value chain.\n\nForm 56-1 One Report\n\n2. Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has developed the Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies to provide them with a clear reporting framework and sustainability performance indicators that respond to the needs of investors and stakeholders in the Thai context. International Sustainability Reporting Guidelines\n\n3. There are various international sustainability reporting standards available, including the GRI Standards, Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework, and Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The Stock Exchange of Thailand encourages listed companies to voluntary disclose information according to these international standards, as appropriate.\n\n1 For more information, please refer to the Form 56-1 (One Report) Reporting \/ Annual Report Manual.\n\n9\n\n02\n\nAbout this Guide\n\nO\n\nb\n\njectives","Conflicts with communities This describes a company’s ability to build relationships with communities and comply with relevant laws, such as those relating to community rights, human rights, and the environment. Furthermore, it demonstrates whether a company effectively handles community grievances to within manageable levels and prevents incidents from deteriorating to the extent that they interrupt business operations, or stop projects entirely. If a company has an increasing number of community conflicts or worsening trends, this reflects the possibility that its business capabilities will decrease, and that it could face higher costs associated with conflict mitigation and resolution.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key information on its community\/social policy, which demonstrates a commitment and\n\nresponsibility to protecting and reducing the impacts of its business operations on communities\/ societies, as well as guidelines or mitigation measures to address community\/social impacts. Note that this information could also be part of a company’s human rights policy and guidelines. 2. Target for developing and engaging with communities that may be affected by the business. Companies should disclose quantitative, comparable and measurable targets, for example, a reduction in the number of complaints or conflicts with communities that are caused by business activities or operations.\n\n3. Community\/social development plans that align with the company’s business context, such as:\n\nCommunity satisfaction surveys, used for developing approaches that respond to the needs of both the community and business.\n\nAnalysis of benefits that the community and company receive from community development efforts, or projects that address social issues.\n\nSupporting sustainable, self-sufficient communities by using business resources, capabilities and capacities to strengthen and elevate their qualities of life.\n\n4. Benefits from community\/social development projects or activities. This is to demonstrate the outcomes and effectiveness of a company’s community development plans. A company can disclose these benefits in financial terms, such as increased income per household, or non- financial terms, such as increase in the number of local suppliers.\n\n5. In the case that a company has conflicts with communities, it should report on the number of grievances and impacts that have occurred, as well as the mitigation and resolution measures adopted.\n\n6. Spending on projects and activities for community\/social development and assistance. This will reveal how suitable a company’s plans are and whether they are reflective of the benefits, value, and impact that the projects and activities deliver.\n\n69\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension\n\nCore (C) Indicators\n\nRecommended (R) Indicators\n\nGRI Standards\n\nSDGs\n\nG1 Policy, Structure and Governance System Board Composition G1.1C Profiles of individual directors\n\nG1.2C Number of board members\n\nG1.3C Number of independent directors\n\nGRI 102-18 Governance Structure\n\n:\n\nGoal 5: Gender Equality Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\n\nG1.4C Number of non-executive directors\n\nG1.5C Number of female directors\n\nG1.6C Independent chairman of the board\n\nG1.7C Separation of the roles of chairman and CEO\n\nG1.8C Number of independent directors in each sub-committee G1.9C Independent chairman of each sub-committee G1.10C Number of years of tenure for individual directors\n\n70\n\nRationale • Board composition Board composition is essential for demonstrating that a company’s governance structure is transparent and independent. Companies should have an appropriately sufficient number of directors for their business needs, and should consider a diverse range of director qualifications to ensure that different viewpoints are captured for the benefit of the business. In particular, companies should encourage a higher number of female directors to support equal gender rights within their businesses.","Form 56-1 One Report\n\n2.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2.

Well- established assessment criteria and scales can facilitate the analysis of climate risks and the risk prioritization process. Common criteria used for risk assessment include likelihood, magnitude of impact, adaptability and recovery.\n\nA rating scale can be applied to each criterion, which enables quantitative comparisons of the climate risks. For example, likelihood can be divided into five different categories: rare (1), unlikely (2), possible (3), likely (4), and very likely (5). Each category is assigned a score. The number in the bracket represents the score. The higher the score, the more significant the risk. A well-defined rating scale is essential for consistent interpretation of the materiality of the climate risks identified.\n\nCommon criteria used for risk assessment\n\nCriteria\n\nDescription\n\nExample of a rating scale\n\nLikelihood\n\nProbability of the impact on your business occurring within a specific time horizon\n\nRare (1), unlikely (2), possible (3), likely (4), very likely (5)\n\nMagnitude of impact\n\nMagnitude describes the extent to which the impact, if it occurred, would affect your business\n\nInsignificant (1), minor (2), moderate (3), major (4), significant (5)\n\nAdaptability\n\nCapacity of an entity to adapt and respond to risks\n\nVery low (1), low (2), medium (3), high (4), very high (5)\n\nRecovery\n\nCapacity of an entity to return to tolerance\n\nVery slow (1), slow (2), medium (3), fast (4), very fast (5)\n\n| 19\n\n2.

Analyse the climate risk assessment result and prioritize risks\n\nBased on the result of the climate risk assessment, a risk matrix can be constructed to visualize and analyse the materiality of all the climate risks, determining the priority of risks. Companies can determine the x-axis and y-axis of a risk matrix according to their own set of assessment criteria and scales.\n\nThe example of a risk matrix below shows a two-dimensional graph plotting vulnerability against hazard exposure. Hazard exposure refers to a company that is in a vulnerable setting or position while vulnerability is related to notions of resilience, flexibility and adaption. It refers to the propensity or predisposition of a company to suffer adversely from its exposure to hazards. Another example of a risk matrix can be a two- dimensional graph, in which the x-axis denotes impact, and the y-axis denotes likelihood.\n\nExample of a risk matrix\n\nVery high 5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nHigh 4\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\ne r u s o p x e d r a z a H\n\nModerate 3\n\nLow 2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n\n9\n\n6\n\n12\n\n8\n\n15\n\n10\n\nVery low 1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nVery low 1\n\nLow 2\n\nModerate 3\n\nHigh 4\n\nVery high 5\n\nVulnerability\n\nCategory 1\n\nRisks with very high materiality\n\nCategory 2\n\nRisks with high materiality\n\nCategory 3\n\nRisks with low materiality\n\nCategory 4\n\nRisks with very low materiality\n\nCompanies can categorize the risks based on their overall score and assign different levels of materiality to each category of risk. The example of a risk matrix above shows that the overall score of a risk is calculated by multiplying the hazard exposure rating by the vulnerability rating. For example, a risk gets four scores in hazard exposure and five scores in vulnerability. Its overall score is 20, which is multiplying four by five. Companies should develop their own calculation methodology and define different levels of materiality and its criteria. A risk matrix can be used to identify risks with different materiality levels and facilitate the risk prioritization process. With limited resources, companies may decide to prioritize addressing risks with high to highest materiality.\n\n| 21\n\nCase study – Climate Risk Assessment and Prioritization\n\nThe risks in the climate risk inventory are assessed by Company X’s expert team in terms\n\nof likelihood, time horizon, financial impact and response to risk.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

In order to effectively execute the implementation plan, regular reviewing and monitoring of the plan is essential. The relevant departments should report the progress of the plan to management so they can assess the effectiveness of the plan and make adjustments where necessary.\n\n| 23\n\nCase study – Climate Risk Response\n\nIn company X, risks are assigned to risk owners, who hold the accountability to manage the\n\nrisks and report to the Executive Team and the Board. Risk owners are given appropriate\n\nauthority and resources for effective risk management. They are authorized to assemble\n\na cross-functional team depending on the scope covered by the risks. The team may\n\ninvolve personnel from different departments and regions across the organization. The\n\nteam works together to develop measures and plans to address specific risks based on\n\nthe risk response chosen. The planning process would provoke discussion about how the\n\nmeasures and plans should be supported by the overall business strategy. This facilitates\n\nthe consideration and integration of climate risks in business strategy planning.\n\nCompany X identified carbon pricing as a material transition risk as it operates energy-\n\nintensive manufacturing sites in different regions like the UK, EU, US and China. Each\n\nregion is subjected to different carbon pricing policies. The risk owner chooses “reduce”\n\nas the risk response to address the risk of carbon pricing. Regional teams are set up to\n\ndevelop measures and plans to reduce the severity of the risks brought by the regional\n\ncarbon pricing policies. It has introduced energy-efficiency machinery and sourced\n\nrenewable energy to reduce GHG emissions. Metrics such as annual GHG emissions are\n\ndeveloped to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures. The risk owners and their cross-\n\nfunctional team conduct a quarterly evaluation of the effectiveness of the measures based\n\non the pre-defined metrics and adjust the plan if necessary. The risk owners have to report\n\nto the Executive team and the Board on major issues regarding risk management on an\n\nannual basis.\n\nAs Company X anticipates stricter regulations on carbon pricing in the long term, it has set\n\na net-zero target by 2050 as one of the business strategies at the company level. This is to\n\nensure different levels of employees within the company are aware of the company goal\n\nand take action to pursue the same goal together.

The purpose of this section is to provide practical guidance to companies who are looking to implement TCFD recommendations within their organization.\n\nThis report consolidates some examples of good practices, which are inspired by real-world use cases. These examples are used to illustrate how the TCFD recommendations are implemented and provide insights to companies to develop their own strategy and approach. The case studies and examples included in this report do not demonstrate the only approach to implementing the TCFD recommendations, but rather serve as examples to illustrate how they have been implemented in practice, which provides companies with a point of reference. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and companies should adapt the TCFD recommendations to their unique organizational context.\n\n| 3\n\nInterdependencies of the TCFD Pillars\n\nThe diagram below shows the interdependencies between all four TCFD pillars and highlights the importance of reporting. The TCFD pillars are governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\nA well-established governance structure can ensure that climate issues are addressed across the organization as a matter of priority and in an effective manner. It is a prerequisite to effectively identifying, assessing and managing a wide spectrum of climate issues, as well as formulating an ambitious and practical climate strategy.\n\nRisk management is too often seen as a compliance exercise and not truly integrated with business strategy, objectives and decision-making. To effectively address climate challenges, business strategy should take climate-related issues into consideration. Through the climate risk identification and assessment exercise, companies can identify climate risks that are material to their business and choose the appropriate risk response to address those issues. However, adopting a risk response that is not aligned with the business strategy is ineffective to address climate risks. Climate risk responses that are in line with overall business strategies can ensure all levels of the company are working together to achieve a common goal.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of climate reporting is often underestimated by companies. It is worthwhile to note that reporting is an important tool to communicate a company’s performance and actions against climate-related issues. By disclosing climate-related issues in a transparent way, companies can receive valuable feedback from their internal and external stakeholders, including investors, on how they can further improve their climate governance, strategy, and risk management. Companies can then evaluate their approach and strategy on climate-related issues and update their stakeholders on any significant changes, forming an effective feedback loop.\n\nStrategy\n\nFeedback\n\nGovernance\n\nReporting\n\nClimate risk management (metrics and targets)\n\nClimate risk identiﬁcation and assessment\n\nFeedback\n\n| 4\n\nTCFD Journey Roadmap - identify your stage in the environmental journey\n\nThe TCFD roadmap, which is shown in the table below, describes the characteristics of four different environmental stages, namely early, developing, mature and best practice, based on the four TCFD pillars. Companies are advised to make use of this roadmap to identify the stage that they are currently in and focus on the key areas that help them progress towards the next stage, with achieving best practice as the ultimate goal.\n\nEarly\n\nDeveloping\n\nMature\n\nBest Practice\n\nGovernance\n\nBoard level oversight over key climate issues\n\nNo board member has oversight over climate issues\n\nNo board member has oversight over climate issues, or the company is starting to consider board level oversight, but no formal process is yet in place.\n\nBoard has oversight over climate issues, but climate is not considered in strategic decision-making process"],"response":"Time horizons covered in the risk and opportunities assessment should include short, medium, and long-term views. The process involves conducting climate scenario analysis to understand potential future states and their implications. \n\nA risk management process must be established to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks and opportunities. This includes evaluating the types of risks (both physical and transition), the likelihood of occurrence, and the magnitude of their potential impact.\n\nCommon approaches for risk assessment include expert input, scenario analysis, and the use of climate-specific tools. Building a climate risk inventory is essential, as it helps categorize identified risks and their relevance to the organization.\n\nRegular reviews and updates of the climate risk inventory and identification processes ensure that they remain comprehensive and relevant. Metrics should be developed to assess the risks and opportunities in line with the organization's strategy and risk management process.","reference":"The climate risk identification process lays the foundation for further detailed analysis and assessment of climate risks. Companies must identify available approaches and tools for climate risk assessment, understanding their strengths and weaknesses. After selecting appropriate tools, companies can assess and rate risks in the climate risk inventory based on defined assessment criteria and scale. Key steps include: 1. Utilizing expert input to leverage knowledge from professionals, 2. Conducting scenario analysis to explore potential implications of various future states, 3. Employing forecasting and valuation using historical data to estimate impacts on revenues and costs, 4. Using climate-specific tools for quantifying risks, 5. Gathering primary data from internal sources and surveys, and 6. Incorporating secondary data from academic and industry research. Following the assessment, a risk matrix can be constructed to visualize and prioritize risks based on their materiality.","context_recall":1.0,"factual_correctness":0.29,"faithfulness":1.0,"semantic_similarity":0.937212273}

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","3.

In addition, data on the number of employees can reveal whether an organization’s size and structure are appropriately suited to its needs. For example, reporting on the number of employees by age group shows that a company possesses experiences across different generations. However, if there are too many younger employees, the business may be lacking in experienced personnel, whereas if there are too many employees close to retirement, the business risks facing a labor shortage. This information is important for helping a company to prepare its human resources for the future. Furthermore, data on employees across different categories can demonstrate workforce diversity in terms of gender, age, roles and responsibilities and geographies, and this can help to foster opportunities for persons with disabilities\n\n5 and the elderly.6\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Number of employees in the past year, categorized by gender, age, and employment level (such\n\nas staff, management, and senior management).

They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.","Conflicts with communities This describes a company’s ability to build relationships with communities and comply with relevant laws, such as those relating to community rights, human rights, and the environment. Furthermore, it demonstrates whether a company effectively handles community grievances to within manageable levels and prevents incidents from deteriorating to the extent that they interrupt business operations, or stop projects entirely. If a company has an increasing number of community conflicts or worsening trends, this reflects the possibility that its business capabilities will decrease, and that it could face higher costs associated with conflict mitigation and resolution.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key information on its community\/social policy, which demonstrates a commitment and\n\nresponsibility to protecting and reducing the impacts of its business operations on communities\/ societies, as well as guidelines or mitigation measures to address community\/social impacts. Note that this information could also be part of a company’s human rights policy and guidelines. 2. Target for developing and engaging with communities that may be affected by the business. Companies should disclose quantitative, comparable and measurable targets, for example, a reduction in the number of complaints or conflicts with communities that are caused by business activities or operations.\n\n3. Community\/social development plans that align with the company’s business context, such as:\n\nCommunity satisfaction surveys, used for developing approaches that respond to the needs of both the community and business.\n\nAnalysis of benefits that the community and company receive from community development efforts, or projects that address social issues.\n\nSupporting sustainable, self-sufficient communities by using business resources, capabilities and capacities to strengthen and elevate their qualities of life.\n\n4. Benefits from community\/social development projects or activities. This is to demonstrate the outcomes and effectiveness of a company’s community development plans. A company can disclose these benefits in financial terms, such as increased income per household, or non- financial terms, such as increase in the number of local suppliers.\n\n5. In the case that a company has conflicts with communities, it should report on the number of grievances and impacts that have occurred, as well as the mitigation and resolution measures adopted.\n\n6. Spending on projects and activities for community\/social development and assistance. This will reveal how suitable a company’s plans are and whether they are reflective of the benefits, value, and impact that the projects and activities deliver.\n\n69\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension\n\nCore (C) Indicators\n\nRecommended (R) Indicators\n\nGRI Standards\n\nSDGs\n\nG1 Policy, Structure and Governance System Board Composition G1.1C Profiles of individual directors\n\nG1.2C Number of board members\n\nG1.3C Number of independent directors\n\nGRI 102-18 Governance Structure\n\n:\n\nGoal 5: Gender Equality Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\n\nG1.4C Number of non-executive directors\n\nG1.5C Number of female directors\n\nG1.6C Independent chairman of the board\n\nG1.7C Separation of the roles of chairman and CEO\n\nG1.8C Number of independent directors in each sub-committee G1.9C Independent chairman of each sub-committee G1.10C Number of years of tenure for individual directors\n\n70\n\nRationale • Board composition Board composition is essential for demonstrating that a company’s governance structure is transparent and independent.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

These\n\nshould show that a company is aware of the impacts of its marketing communications tools on customers\/consumers, and that it does not support advertising or sales promotion activities that promote illegal or immoral conduct.\n\n2. Measures and outcomes of communicating about its products or services in a transparent and comprehensive way, to help consumers make decisions. A company may present information or warnings about the use of a product and\/or service through user manuals, product labels or packaging. Additionally, a company should not communicate information about its products or services in ways that are unrealistic or misleading.

employees over the long term. The success of this is reflected in the employee turnover rate. If the employee turnover rate rises, particularly in key positions, this may lead to the risk of staff shortages, which will impact the human resources structure. A company may also face higher costs of hiring and developing new employees to replace those who have left.\n\nEmployee engagement results This demonstrates how a company promotes collective bargaining, such as through the Benefits Committee and Labor Relations Committee. It shows that a company actively provides employees with the channels to express their views and expectations, and to engage with employers and management. This information can then serve as input for a company’s employee development and retention plans. • Number of labor disputes If there is an increase in the frequency of labor disputes, this points to problems with a company’s labor management. If the majority of such disputes are related to human rights violations, there is also a risk of severe impacts to business continuity.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach.

These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.","Water management\n\nThis indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing negative environmental impacts through resource use efficiency. It also demonstrates a company’s commitment to reusing or recycling waste by bringing it back into business processes to create added value for the business.\n\nGreenhouse gas management This indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy and resource consumption across its value chain. These are significant contributors to the climate crisis and global warming, and will impact business operations in the future. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Brief overview of its environmental policy and guidelines, to show its approach to environmental management across the value chain. Policies may have similarities or differences from one another depending on the business context.\n\n2. Outcomes from the implementation of its environmental policy and guidelines, to ensure trust in how it manages energy and resources efficiently. In addition, a company should report on efforts to reduce its environmental impacts, as well as the number of incidents or cases of environmental incidents or violations, and explain the corrective measures taken (if any). 3. The value of fines or damages, in financial terms, resulting from environmental violations or incidents (if any), as well as the value of damages paid to individuals who were impacted by the company’s actions on the environment.\n\n4. How the company has applied environmental standards within its operational context in order to elevate the quality of environmental management.

Data on energy consumption can show trends in a company’s electricity and\/or fuel use each year. If a company is consistently using more energy but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this may reveal that it has higher energy requirements.\n\nt\n\nRenewable energy consumption Renewable energy refers to energy sources such as sunlight, wind, and water, which can be naturally replenished. The use of renewable energy reflects a company’s commitment to reducing its reliance on non-renewable, fossil fuel-based energy, which will help to reduce the risk of future energy shortages and the volume of greenhouse gases emitted from its business processes. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and quantitative targets to reduce electricity and\/or fuel consumption,\n\ndemonstrating its commitment to improving energy use efficiency, reducing energy waste, and continuously improving its effectiveness in managing energy requirements.","(2) Stakeholder expectations Companies should briefly explain the expectations and needs of each\n\nstakeholder group, for example:\n\nStakeholder Group Shareholders\n\nEmployees\n\nCustomers\n\nSuppliers\n\nCommunities\/Societies\n\nExpectations\/Needs Business transparency and regular returns on investment Fair compensation and career progression Good quality and appropriately priced products and services Fair and transparent procurement practices Protection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\n27\n\nWhen reporting on stakeholder expectations, companies should show how their business activities are linked to each stakeholder group. Stakeholders’ expectations should be assessed and analy zed at least once a year through engagement channels such as participatory hearing processes, satisfaction surveys, meetings, or other channels. Companies should use the results from these processes to develop appropriate methods of engagement to minimize risks of conflicts or sanctions against the business, such as boycotts on sales and purchases, sales of company shares, employee resignations, or protests.\n\n(3) Responding to stakeholder expectations Companies should summarize the primary methods, activities, projects,\n\nand communication channels that they use to engage with different stakeholders, such as opinion and satisfaction surveys and seminars. This information demonstrates that a company is regularly engaging with stakeholders and is committed to responding appropriately to the expectations of each stakeholder group and ensuring their satisfaction.\n\n28\n\nTable 1: Example of reporting on stakeholder engagement\n\nStakeholder Group\n\nExpectations\/ Needs\n\nExample of Response\n\nShareholders\n\nBusiness transparency and regular returns on investment\n\nDevelop an internal control system and efficient risk management\n\nTransparent disclosure of information through channels such as the annual shareholders meeting, annual report, and company website.\n\nEmployees\n\nFair compensation and career progression\n\nFair approach to compensation\n\nContinuous skills and capability development\n\nCustomers\n\nGood quality and appropriately priced products and services\n\nContinuous development of products and services\n\nFair pricing -\n\nAfter-sales services to respond to customers’ needs\n\nSuppliers\n\nFair and transparent procurement practices\n\nFair supplier practices and code of conduct for working together Development of suppliers’ skills and capabilities\n\nCommunities\/ Societies\n\nProtection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\nControl and minimization of environmental impacts from business operations - Support for community engagement and development activities, such as community career training\n\n29\n\nExample of Communication Channel\n\nShareholder meeting - Company website - Annual report\/ Sustainability report\n\nEmployee meetings - E-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nCompany website \/\n\nE-mail \/ Social media\n\nSales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management. They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5. Additional references:","18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1.

Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions. Examples include pricing, advertisements, and announcements.\n\nCustomer Services Activities related to enhancing customer satisfaction after sales, to retain customers for the repeat purchases of products and services. Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","4.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","3.

In addition, data on the number of employees can reveal whether an organization’s size and structure are appropriately suited to its needs. For example, reporting on the number of employees by age group shows that a company possesses experiences across different generations. However, if there are too many younger employees, the business may be lacking in experienced personnel, whereas if there are too many employees close to retirement, the business risks facing a labor shortage. This information is important for helping a company to prepare its human resources for the future. Furthermore, data on employees across different categories can demonstrate workforce diversity in terms of gender, age, roles and responsibilities and geographies, and this can help to foster opportunities for persons with disabilities\n\n5 and the elderly.6\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1.

It also demonstrates a company’s commitment to reusing or recycling waste by bringing it back into business processes to create added value for the business.\n\nGreenhouse gas management This indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy and resource consumption across its value chain. These are significant contributors to the climate crisis and global warming, and will impact business operations in the future. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Brief overview of its environmental policy and guidelines, to show its approach to environmental management across the value chain. Policies may have similarities or differences from one another depending on the business context.","2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization.

A sustainable supply chain management process considers environmental and social impacts and good governance, as this will help to mitigate business impacts from issues such as illegal labor and corruption. It also indicates that a company is committed to building relationships with its suppliers and to develop the business while delivering positive results for the economy, society and environment, for example through continuous supplier capacity development and green procurement.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key aspects of its sustainable supply chain management policy and guidelines, or the Supplier Code of Conduct (if applicable), to demonstrate that the company has criteria for procurement covering environmental, social, and good governance practices. Examples include environmentally-friendly procurement of raw materials, products and services, and the prohibition of child or slave labor.\n\n2. Key aspects of the company’s supply chain management plan and clearly defined targets. These plans may cover mitigation measures for supplier-related economic risks (e.g., over- reliance on a small group of suppliers, receiving poor quality products\/services), social issues (e.g., human rights violations, unethical conduct towards employee and laborers), and environmental issues (e.g., environmental law violations).\n\n3. Percentage of new suppliers that passed the supplier screening criteria covering environmental, social, and good governance issues.\n\n4.

Innovations may include things that have not existed before, or things that have been adapted, improved upon or modernized to improve work efficiency, enhance business competitiveness, and benefit society and the environment. However, companies should also demonstrate an innovation culture and disclose the ways in which they encourage employees to innovate and embed innovation into their work, or into products\/services to create added value for the organization.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key elements of its innovation development policy and guidelines, which show the company’s objectives and targets on innovation development in alignment with business direction and growth. This should also show a company’s internal processes for innovation development and promotion, such as innovation showcases, innovative thinking courses, etc. 2. Spending on R&D, innovation activities or innovation project plans over the past year. 3. Summary of benefits or outcomes from innovation development over the past year (if available). For example: “The company developed Innovation ‘A’, which successfully increased customer satisfaction while reducing energy costs by 10%, leading to a cost savings of 300,000 baht and a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous year.” Companies do not need to disclose confidential information so that they can minimize the risk of infringing on any rights, or of revealing any business-sensitive information.\n\n4. In the case that an innovation is not complete, a company can report on their progress in developing the innovation. For example: “The company is currently developing Innovation ‘A’ and is at 60% completion. Innovation A will be piloted next year for a full roll-out the following year.”\n\n83\n\nPerformance Summary: SET ESG Metrics\n\nEnvironmental Dimension\n\nGRI Standards\n\nUnit\n\nCode ESG Indicators E1 Environmental Policy and Compliance Standards Environmental E1.1C management policy and guidelines Number of cases or incidents of legal violations or negative environmental impacts, with explanation of mitigation measures Value of damages or fines received from legal violations or negative environmental impacts Compliance with international energy management principles and standards Compliance with international water management principles and standards Compliance with international waste management principles and standards Compliance with international greenhouse gas management or climate change principles and standards\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nNo. of cases\n\nE1.2C\n\nBaht\n\nE1.3R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.4R\n\nGRI 103\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.5R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.6R","2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights\n\nS2 Fair Labor Practices S3 Responsibility to Customers\/Consumers S4 Responsibility to Communities\/Societies\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension (G) G1 Policy, Structure and Governance System\n\nG2 Sustainability Policy and Strategy G3 Sustainability Risk Management G4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G5 Innovation Development\n\nExplanation\n\nBusiness activities can impact the qualities of life and human rights of many groups of stakeholders. To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies to disclose information concerning their environmental, social, and governance performance across their entire business value chain.\n\nForm 56-1 One Report\n\n2. Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has developed the Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies to provide them with a clear reporting framework and sustainability performance indicators that respond to the needs of investors and stakeholders in the Thai context. International Sustainability Reporting Guidelines\n\n3. There are various international sustainability reporting standards available, including the GRI Standards, Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework, and Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The Stock Exchange of Thailand encourages listed companies to voluntary disclose information according to these international standards, as appropriate.\n\n1 For more information, please refer to the Form 56-1 (One Report) Reporting \/ Annual Report Manual.\n\n9\n\n02\n\nAbout this Guide\n\nO\n\nb\n\njectives"],"response":"Measures to protect and remedy human rights issues should be implemented to minimize the risk of violations within business activities. Establishing human rights governance and compliance with policies ensures fair treatment of stakeholders, leading to improved conditions for employees and laborers, as well as safe products and services for customers. Companies can utilize ESG metrics by monitoring and reporting on their human rights policies, conducting due diligence, tracking incidents of violations, and outlining mitigation measures taken. Additionally, prioritizing these human rights issues in their materiality matrix will help them address the most critical areas effectively. Regular reviews and updates to their human rights practices and stakeholder engagement will further enhance their commitment to respect human rights.","reference":"To ensure respect for human rights in your company, you can utilize the ESG metrics outlined in the sustainability reporting guidelines.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","3.

In addition, data on the number of employees can reveal whether an organization’s size and structure are appropriately suited to its needs. For example, reporting on the number of employees by age group shows that a company possesses experiences across different generations. However, if there are too many younger employees, the business may be lacking in experienced personnel, whereas if there are too many employees close to retirement, the business risks facing a labor shortage. This information is important for helping a company to prepare its human resources for the future. Furthermore, data on employees across different categories can demonstrate workforce diversity in terms of gender, age, roles and responsibilities and geographies, and this can help to foster opportunities for persons with disabilities\n\n5 and the elderly.6\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Number of employees in the past year, categorized by gender, age, and employment level (such\n\nas staff, management, and senior management).

It also demonstrates a company’s commitment to reusing or recycling waste by bringing it back into business processes to create added value for the business.\n\nGreenhouse gas management This indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy and resource consumption across its value chain. These are significant contributors to the climate crisis and global warming, and will impact business operations in the future. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Brief overview of its environmental policy and guidelines, to show its approach to environmental management across the value chain. Policies may have similarities or differences from one another depending on the business context.","2. Key aspects of the company’s supply chain management plan and clearly defined targets. These plans may cover mitigation measures for supplier-related economic risks (e.g., over- reliance on a small group of suppliers, receiving poor quality products\/services), social issues (e.g., human rights violations, unethical conduct towards employee and laborers), and environmental issues (e.g., environmental law violations).\n\n3.

Innovations may include things that have not existed before, or things that have been adapted, improved upon or modernized to improve work efficiency, enhance business competitiveness, and benefit society and the environment. However, companies should also demonstrate an innovation culture and disclose the ways in which they encourage employees to innovate and embed innovation into their work, or into products\/services to create added value for the organization.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key elements of its innovation development policy and guidelines, which show the company’s objectives and targets on innovation development in alignment with business direction and growth. This should also show a company’s internal processes for innovation development and promotion, such as innovation showcases, innovative thinking courses, etc. 2. Spending on R&D, innovation activities or innovation project plans over the past year. 3. Summary of benefits or outcomes from innovation development over the past year (if available). For example: “The company developed Innovation ‘A’, which successfully increased customer satisfaction while reducing energy costs by 10%, leading to a cost savings of 300,000 baht and a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous year.” Companies do not need to disclose confidential information so that they can minimize the risk of infringing on any rights, or of revealing any business-sensitive information.\n\n4. In the case that an innovation is not complete, a company can report on their progress in developing the innovation. For example: “The company is currently developing Innovation ‘A’ and is at 60% completion.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business.

However, if the volume of greenhouse gases becomes too high, this will cause the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to the current problem where greenhouse gases are significant contributors to negative environmental impacts and climate change. All sectors of society are therefore encouraging businesses to manage reductions in the seven greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen fluoride (NF3).\n\n4 ), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur\n\n57\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gases are emitted from different organizational activities, for example from electricity use in production processes or services, and fuel use in transportation. If a company is consistently emitting more greenhouse gas emissions but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this reveals an imbalance between its energy and resource requirements compared to its ability to generate profit. It also reveals the environmental impacts that a company causes from its operations. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its business activities. 2. Greenhouse gas emissions by source, reported in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO\n\n2e),\n\nacross three scopes: Scope 1:\n\nDirect greenhouse gas emissions, such as from combustion in machinery use, transport fleets, and chemicals used for wastewater treatment and cooling systems. Indirect greenhouse gas emissions, such as electricity purchases or steam. Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions (if any), such as municipal water supply use, employee travel, waste disposal to landfill, and energy and resource use by other stakeholders in the value chain.\n\nScope 2: Scope 3:\n\n3.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies to disclose information concerning their environmental, social, and governance performance across their entire business value chain.\n\nForm 56-1 One Report\n\n2. Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has developed the Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies to provide them with a clear reporting framework and sustainability performance indicators that respond to the needs of investors and stakeholders in the Thai context. International Sustainability Reporting Guidelines\n\n3. There are various international sustainability reporting standards available, including the GRI Standards, Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework, and Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The Stock Exchange of Thailand encourages listed companies to voluntary disclose information according to these international standards, as appropriate.\n\n1 For more information, please refer to the Form 56-1 (One Report) Reporting \/ Annual Report Manual.\n\n9\n\n02\n\nAbout this Guide\n\nO\n\nb\n\njectives","Water management\n\nThis indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing negative environmental impacts through resource use efficiency.

In addition, if a company is able to assess climate-related risks and establish mitigation measures for such risks, it will be able to identify opportunities to integrate renewable energy into its business.\n\n4\n\nA greenhouse gas has the property of absorbing heat or infrared radiation, which helps to stabilize the Earth’s atmospheric temperature. However, if the volume of greenhouse gases becomes too high, this will cause the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to the current problem where greenhouse gases are significant contributors to negative environmental impacts and climate change. All sectors of society are therefore encouraging businesses to manage reductions in the seven greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen fluoride (NF3).\n\n4 ), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur\n\n57\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gases are emitted from different organizational activities, for example from electricity use in production processes or services, and fuel use in transportation. If a company is consistently emitting more greenhouse gas emissions but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this reveals an imbalance between its energy and resource requirements compared to its ability to generate profit. It also reveals the environmental impacts that a company causes from its operations. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its business activities. 2. Greenhouse gas emissions by source, reported in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO\n\n2e),\n\nacross three scopes: Scope 1:\n\nDirect greenhouse gas emissions, such as from combustion in machinery use, transport fleets, and chemicals used for wastewater treatment and cooling systems.

The baseline data for greenhouse gas emissions is derived from fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation of the national grid, which is substituted with renewable energy. 2. **Baseline Emission Calculation**: Baseline emissions are calculated using the formula BEy = EGPJ,y X EF Elec,y, where BEy represents baseline emissions in year y (tCO2\/year), EGPJ,y is the quantity of net electricity generation produced and fed into the grid in year y (MWh), and EF Elec,y is the emission factor for electricity generation\/consumption in year y (tCO2\/MWh). 3. **Specific Scenarios**: For Greenfield power plants, the baseline scenario is the generation of electricity from project activities for selling through the national grid. For retrofit, rehabilitation, or replacement projects, the baseline scenario is based on the continuous operation of the existing power plant using historical power generation data. 4. **Historical Data**: The calculation of historical net power generation levels is crucial, with options for retrospective periods of either the past 3 years or a longer timeframe that includes at least five calendar years. This historical data is essential for determining the baseline emissions accurately.","context_recall":1.0,"factual_correctness":0.52,"faithfulness":1.0,"semantic_similarity":0.924777345}

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1.

If a company has organizational-level sustainability targets, this makes it more apparent that it has a defined direction and objectives to support its sustainability policy, and to measure and assess performance.\n\nMaterial topics Material topics are economic, social, and environmental topics that a company has determined to be important and urgent, and which affect its ability to do business. In addition, material topics reflect the issues that are important to both a company and its stakeholders. These topics can help a company to develop its business direction and strategy, and ensure that this aligns with stakeholders’ expectations within its operational context.\n\nSustainability report A document that contains information about a company’s environmental, social, and governance performance. The information contained within a sustainability report is targeted to the needs of investors, shareholders, customers, communities and stakeholders who would use the information. A sustainability report is additional to regular financial reporting and annual reports, which may not provide a comprehensive overview of business performance. A sustainability report is also beneficial for companies to monitor and assess their performance, business risks and opportunities, and can serve as a tool for consolidating information for business development and investment decisions.

It will help them in their decisions to invest in businesses that operate with good governance, and which consider economic, social, and environmental risks.\n\n2.\n\n15\n\n03\n\nSustainability Reporting Guidelines\n\nSustainability Reporting Principles\n\nThe Stock Exchange of Thailand has identified the following sustainability reporting principles for listed companies, which will enable them to produce quality reports that will benefit both those preparing and using the information:\n\n1. Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations","Indicators and Performance\n\nThe company uses secondary energy in the production process, which is an indirect energy source from the Metropolitan Electricity Authority In 2020, the company 941,000 kWh, a decrease of 7\n\n.\n\n’s electricity consumption totaled 6, , when consumption was 7\n\n.14% from 2019 - However, energy intensity per product totaled 3.66 M\n\n,475,000 kWh. J per product, which .66% that the company had set\n\nwas higher than the energy target of 27 as an energy performance indicator in 2020. This was due to a decline in the production factor and the fact that the company had to decrease . -19 production times in response to CO\n\nD\n\nI\n\nV\n\n37\n\n.\n\n05\n\nESG Metrics\n\nThis manual\n\ncontains a total of 122 baseline ESG metrics to help\n\ncompanies prepare sustainability reports that align with the disclosure requirements of stakeholders.

It also demonstrates a company’s readiness to handle risks concerning future energy crises, and how it identifies new business opportunities from renewable energy.\n\n52\n\nThis indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing water shortage risks and preventing negative environmental impacts from water use, including through community water resources conservation and restoration. Waste management\n\nWater management\n\nThis indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing negative environmental impacts through resource use efficiency. It also demonstrates a company’s commitment to reusing or recycling waste by bringing it back into business processes to create added value for the business.\n\nGreenhouse gas management This indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy and resource consumption across its value chain. These are significant contributors to the climate crisis and global warming, and will impact business operations in the future. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Brief overview of its environmental policy and guidelines, to show its approach to environmental management across the value chain. Policies may have similarities or differences from one another depending on the business context.","2. Key aspects of the company’s supply chain management plan and clearly defined targets. These plans may cover mitigation measures for supplier-related economic risks (e.g., over- reliance on a small group of suppliers, receiving poor quality products\/services), social issues (e.g., human rights violations, unethical conduct towards employee and laborers), and environmental issues (e.g., environmental law violations).\n\n3. Percentage of new suppliers that passed the supplier screening criteria covering environmental, social, and good governance issues.\n\n4.

Innovations may include things that have not existed before, or things that have been adapted, improved upon or modernized to improve work efficiency, enhance business competitiveness, and benefit society and the environment. However, companies should also demonstrate an innovation culture and disclose the ways in which they encourage employees to innovate and embed innovation into their work, or into products\/services to create added value for the organization.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key elements of its innovation development policy and guidelines, which show the company’s objectives and targets on innovation development in alignment with business direction and growth. This should also show a company’s internal processes for innovation development and promotion, such as innovation showcases, innovative thinking courses, etc. 2. Spending on R&D, innovation activities or innovation project plans over the past year. 3. Summary of benefits or outcomes from innovation development over the past year (if available). For example: “The company developed Innovation ‘A’, which successfully increased customer satisfaction while reducing energy costs by 10%, leading to a cost savings of 300,000 baht and a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous year.” Companies do not need to disclose confidential information so that they can minimize the risk of infringing on any rights, or of revealing any business-sensitive information.\n\n4. In the case that an innovation is not complete, a company can report on their progress in developing the innovation. For example: “The company is currently developing Innovation ‘A’ and is at 60% completion. Innovation A will be piloted next year for a full roll-out the following year.”\n\n83\n\nPerformance Summary: SET ESG Metrics\n\nEnvironmental Dimension\n\nGRI Standards\n\nUnit\n\nCode ESG Indicators E1 Environmental Policy and Compliance Standards Environmental E1.1C management policy and guidelines Number of cases or incidents of legal violations or negative environmental impacts, with explanation of mitigation measures Value of damages or fines received from legal violations or negative environmental impacts Compliance with international energy management principles and standards Compliance with international water management principles and standards Compliance with international waste management principles and standards Compliance with international greenhouse gas management or climate change principles and standards\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nNo. of cases\n\nE1.2C\n\nBaht\n\nE1.3R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.4R\n\nGRI 103\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.5R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.6R","Scope 2: Scope 3:\n\n3.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic. These should align with the objectives and targets that they have set for that material topic and include the following:\n\n4.3.2","2.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights\n\nS2 Fair Labor Practices S3 Responsibility to Customers\/Consumers S4 Responsibility to Communities\/Societies\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension (G) G1 Policy, Structure and Governance System\n\nG2 Sustainability Policy and Strategy G3 Sustainability Risk Management G4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G5 Innovation Development\n\nExplanation\n\nBusiness activities can impact the qualities of life and human rights of many groups of stakeholders. To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

In addition, if a company is able to assess climate-related risks and establish mitigation measures for such risks, it will be able to identify opportunities to integrate renewable energy into its business.\n\n4\n\nA greenhouse gas has the property of absorbing heat or infrared radiation, which helps to stabilize the Earth’s atmospheric temperature. However, if the volume of greenhouse gases becomes too high, this will cause the Earth’s temperature to rise, leading to the current problem where greenhouse gases are significant contributors to negative environmental impacts and climate change. All sectors of society are therefore encouraging businesses to manage reductions in the seven greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen fluoride (NF3).\n\n4 ), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur\n\n57\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse gases are emitted from different organizational activities, for example from electricity use in production processes or services, and fuel use in transportation. If a company is consistently emitting more greenhouse gas emissions but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this reveals an imbalance between its energy and resource requirements compared to its ability to generate profit. It also reveals the environmental impacts that a company causes from its operations. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its business activities. 2. Greenhouse gas emissions by source, reported in tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO\n\n2e),\n\nacross three scopes: Scope 1:\n\nDirect greenhouse gas emissions, such as from combustion in machinery use, transport fleets, and chemicals used for wastewater treatment and cooling systems.

Innovations may include things that have not existed before, or things that have been adapted, improved upon or modernized to improve work efficiency, enhance business competitiveness, and benefit society and the environment. However, companies should also demonstrate an innovation culture and disclose the ways in which they encourage employees to innovate and embed innovation into their work, or into products\/services to create added value for the organization.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key elements of its innovation development policy and guidelines, which show the company’s objectives and targets on innovation development in alignment with business direction and growth. This should also show a company’s internal processes for innovation development and promotion, such as innovation showcases, innovative thinking courses, etc. 2. Spending on R&D, innovation activities or innovation project plans over the past year. 3. Summary of benefits or outcomes from innovation development over the past year (if available). For example: “The company developed Innovation ‘A’, which successfully increased customer satisfaction while reducing energy costs by 10%, leading to a cost savings of 300,000 baht and a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the previous year.” Companies do not need to disclose confidential information so that they can minimize the risk of infringing on any rights, or of revealing any business-sensitive information.\n\n4. In the case that an innovation is not complete, a company can report on their progress in developing the innovation. For example: “The company is currently developing Innovation ‘A’ and is at 60% completion. Innovation A will be piloted next year for a full roll-out the following year.”\n\n83\n\nPerformance Summary: SET ESG Metrics\n\nEnvironmental Dimension\n\nGRI Standards\n\nUnit\n\nCode ESG Indicators E1 Environmental Policy and Compliance Standards Environmental E1.1C management policy and guidelines Number of cases or incidents of legal violations or negative environmental impacts, with explanation of mitigation measures Value of damages or fines received from legal violations or negative environmental impacts Compliance with international energy management principles and standards Compliance with international water management principles and standards Compliance with international waste management principles and standards Compliance with international greenhouse gas management or climate change principles and standards\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nNo. of cases\n\nE1.2C\n\nBaht\n\nE1.3R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.4R\n\nGRI 103\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.5R\n\nYes\/\n\nNo\n\nE1.6R","Sales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management. They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others."],"response":"Companies can effectively implement greenhouse gas management practices by establishing a comprehensive environmental policy that outlines their commitment to reducing emissions across their value chain. They should set measurable targets for greenhouse gas reduction, report emissions by source (Scope 1, 2, and 3), and calculate their carbon intensity. Implementing management plans that focus on energy efficiency and integrating renewable energy sources will further align their practices with ESG metrics. Regular performance evaluations using defined indicators will help assess progress and maintain transparency in sustainability reporting. Engaging stakeholders and adopting recognized standards like ISO 14001 will enhance credibility and support continuous improvement in managing greenhouse gas emissions.","reference":"To effectively implement greenhouse gas management practices, companies should develop a comprehensive greenhouse gas management plan (E5.1C) that outlines their strategies for reducing emissions. This plan should include specific targets for greenhouse gas reduction (E5.4R) and a detailed assessment of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (E5.2C). Additionally, companies should ensure external verification of their greenhouse gas emissions data (E5.3C) to enhance transparency and build stakeholder trust. By aligning their practices with the recommended indicators, such as total greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) (E5.5R) and carbon intensity (E5.6R), companies can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and effectively report their progress in sustainability reports.","context_recall":1.0,"factual_correctness":0.33,"faithfulness":1.0,"semantic_similarity":0.9566966691}

In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights\n\nS2 Fair Labor Practices S3 Responsibility to Customers\/Consumers S4 Responsibility to Communities\/Societies\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension (G) G1 Policy, Structure and Governance System\n\nG2 Sustainability Policy and Strategy G3 Sustainability Risk Management G4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G5 Innovation Development\n\nExplanation\n\nBusiness activities can impact the qualities of life and human rights of many groups of stakeholders. To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions. Examples include pricing, advertisements, and announcements.\n\nCustomer Services Activities related to enhancing customer satisfaction after sales, to retain customers for the repeat purchases of products and services. Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies The Stock Exchange of Thailand\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe contents and information contained herein have been compiled for informational, educational and reference purposes only, the rights of which belong to The Stock Exchange of Thailand or a delegated authority (if applicable), under the protection of copyright laws.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies to disclose information concerning their environmental, social, and governance performance across their entire business value chain.\n\nForm 56-1 One Report\n\n2.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1.

This will help to stimulate interest for readers, make content easier to memorize, and enhance communications efficiency.\n\n3.\n\n21\n\n04\n\nElements of Sustainability Reporting\n\n4.1 Part 1:\n\nEssential Information\n\nCompanies should provide an overview of their business operations, as this will help information users to understand their operational context and the business activities that affect stakeholders. Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions. Examples include pricing, advertisements, and announcements.\n\nCustomer Services Activities related to enhancing customer satisfaction after sales, to retain customers for the repeat purchases of products and services. Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights\n\nS2 Fair Labor Practices S3 Responsibility to Customers\/Consumers S4 Responsibility to Communities\/Societies\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension (G) G1 Policy, Structure and Governance System\n\nG2 Sustainability Policy and Strategy G3 Sustainability Risk Management G4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G5 Innovation Development\n\nExplanation\n\nBusiness activities can impact the qualities of life and human rights of many groups of stakeholders. To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies to disclose information concerning their environmental, social, and governance performance across their entire business value chain.\n\nForm 56-1 One Report\n\n2. Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has developed the Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies to provide them with a clear reporting framework and sustainability performance indicators that respond to the needs of investors and stakeholders in the Thai context. International Sustainability Reporting Guidelines\n\n3. There are various international sustainability reporting standards available, including the GRI Standards, Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework, and Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The Stock Exchange of Thailand encourages listed companies to voluntary disclose information according to these international standards, as appropriate.\n\n1 For more information, please refer to the Form 56-1 (One Report) Reporting \/ Annual Report Manual.\n\n9\n\n02\n\nAbout this Guide\n\nO\n\nb\n\njectives","Sales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management. They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.","4.

A sustainable supply chain management process considers environmental and social impacts and good governance, as this will help to mitigate business impacts from issues such as illegal labor and corruption. It also indicates that a company is committed to building relationships with its suppliers and to develop the business while delivering positive results for the economy, society and environment, for example through continuous supplier capacity development and green procurement.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key aspects of its sustainable supply chain management policy and guidelines, or the Supplier Code of Conduct (if applicable), to demonstrate that the company has criteria for procurement covering environmental, social, and good governance practices. Examples include environmentally-friendly procurement of raw materials, products and services, and the prohibition of child or slave labor.\n\n2. Key aspects of the company’s supply chain management plan and clearly defined targets. These plans may cover mitigation measures for supplier-related economic risks (e.g., over- reliance on a small group of suppliers, receiving poor quality products\/services), social issues (e.g., human rights violations, unethical conduct towards employee and laborers), and environmental issues (e.g., environmental law violations).\n\n3. Percentage of new suppliers that passed the supplier screening criteria covering environmental, social, and good governance issues.\n\n4. Percentage of key suppliers acknowledging the company’s supplier code of conduct.

Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1.

This will help to stimulate interest for readers, make content easier to memorize, and enhance communications efficiency.\n\n3.\n\n21\n\n04\n\nElements of Sustainability Reporting\n\n4.1 Part 1:\n\nEssential Information\n\nCompanies should provide an overview of their business operations, as this will help information users to understand their operational context and the business activities that affect stakeholders. Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions. Examples include pricing, advertisements, and announcements.\n\nCustomer Services Activities related to enhancing customer satisfaction after sales, to retain customers for the repeat purchases of products and services. Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","2.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations","(2) Stakeholder expectations Companies should briefly explain the expectations and needs of each\n\nstakeholder group, for example:\n\nStakeholder Group Shareholders\n\nEmployees\n\nCustomers\n\nSuppliers\n\nCommunities\/Societies\n\nExpectations\/Needs Business transparency and regular returns on investment Fair compensation and career progression Good quality and appropriately priced products and services Fair and transparent procurement practices Protection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\n27\n\nWhen reporting on stakeholder expectations, companies should show how their business activities are linked to each stakeholder group. Stakeholders’ expectations should be assessed and analy zed at least once a year through engagement channels such as participatory hearing processes, satisfaction surveys, meetings, or other channels. Companies should use the results from these processes to develop appropriate methods of engagement to minimize risks of conflicts or sanctions against the business, such as boycotts on sales and purchases, sales of company shares, employee resignations, or protests.\n\n(3) Responding to stakeholder expectations Companies should summarize the primary methods, activities, projects,\n\nand communication channels that they use to engage with different stakeholders, such as opinion and satisfaction surveys and seminars. This information demonstrates that a company is regularly engaging with stakeholders and is committed to responding appropriately to the expectations of each stakeholder group and ensuring their satisfaction.\n\n28\n\nTable 1: Example of reporting on stakeholder engagement\n\nStakeholder Group\n\nExpectations\/ Needs\n\nExample of Response\n\nShareholders\n\nBusiness transparency and regular returns on investment\n\nDevelop an internal control system and efficient risk management\n\nTransparent disclosure of information through channels such as the annual shareholders meeting, annual report, and company website.\n\nEmployees\n\nFair compensation and career progression\n\nFair approach to compensation\n\nContinuous skills and capability development\n\nCustomers\n\nGood quality and appropriately priced products and services\n\nContinuous development of products and services\n\nFair pricing -\n\nAfter-sales services to respond to customers’ needs\n\nSuppliers\n\nFair and transparent procurement practices\n\nFair supplier practices and code of conduct for working together Development of suppliers’ skills and capabilities\n\nCommunities\/ Societies\n\nProtection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\nControl and minimization of environmental impacts from business operations - Support for community engagement and development activities, such as community career training\n\n29\n\nExample of Communication Channel\n\nShareholder meeting - Company website - Annual report\/ Sustainability report\n\nEmployee meetings - E-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nCompany website \/\n\nE-mail \/ Social media\n\nSales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management.

A sustainable supply chain management process considers environmental and social impacts and good governance, as this will help to mitigate business impacts from issues such as illegal labor and corruption. It also indicates that a company is committed to building relationships with its suppliers and to develop the business while delivering positive results for the economy, society and environment, for example through continuous supplier capacity development and green procurement.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key aspects of its sustainable supply chain management policy and guidelines, or the Supplier Code of Conduct (if applicable), to demonstrate that the company has criteria for procurement covering environmental, social, and good governance practices. Examples include environmentally-friendly procurement of raw materials, products and services, and the prohibition of child or slave labor.\n\n2. Key aspects of the company’s supply chain management plan and clearly defined targets. These plans may cover mitigation measures for supplier-related economic risks (e.g., over- reliance on a small group of suppliers, receiving poor quality products\/services), social issues (e.g., human rights violations, unethical conduct towards employee and laborers), and environmental issues (e.g., environmental law violations).\n\n3. Percentage of new suppliers that passed the supplier screening criteria covering environmental, social, and good governance issues.\n\n4. Percentage of key suppliers acknowledging the company’s supplier code of conduct. Key suppliers can be identified based on procurement spend or the volume of products\/services received (if applicable).\n\n5.

If a company has organizational-level sustainability targets, this makes it more apparent that it has a defined direction and objectives to support its sustainability policy, and to measure and assess performance.\n\nMaterial topics Material topics are economic, social, and environmental topics that a company has determined to be important and urgent, and which affect its ability to do business. In addition, material topics reflect the issues that are important to both a company and its stakeholders. These topics can help a company to develop its business direction and strategy, and ensure that this aligns with stakeholders’ expectations within its operational context.\n\nSustainability report A document that contains information about a company’s environmental, social, and governance performance.

For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization.

Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights\n\nS2 Fair Labor Practices S3 Responsibility to Customers\/Consumers S4 Responsibility to Communities\/Societies\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension (G) G1 Policy, Structure and Governance System\n\nG2 Sustainability Policy and Strategy G3 Sustainability Risk Management G4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G5 Innovation Development\n\nExplanation\n\nBusiness activities can impact the qualities of life and human rights of many groups of stakeholders. To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach.

This will help to stimulate interest for readers, make content easier to memorize, and enhance communications efficiency.\n\n3.\n\n21\n\n04\n\nElements of Sustainability Reporting\n\n4.1 Part 1:\n\nEssential Information\n\nCompanies should provide an overview of their business operations, as this will help information users to understand their operational context and the business activities that affect stakeholders. Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers.

To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic. These should align with the objectives and targets that they have set for that material topic and include the following:\n\n4.3.2\n\n(1) Resource allocation, e.g., who is the responsible owner, the equipment,\n\ntools, machinery, and capital used;\n\n(2) Protection and remediation measures in cases of problems or obstacles;\n\nand\n\n(3) How it is engaging relevant stakeholders.\n\nIndicators and Performance Companies should report performance that is measurable, and evaluate their performance on each material topic using clear performance indicators. This will enable companies to see their progress against targets and ensure that their sustainability journeys are effective and ongoing.\n\n4.3.3\n\n36\n\nTable 4: Example of how to report a management approach for a material topic\n\nMaterial Topic\n\nObjectives and Targets\n\nEnergy Management ’s energy consumption to ensure highest efficiency\n\nManage the company Consider efficient natural resource use, reduce environmental impacts and energy costs.\n\nThe company\n\n’s 2020 target is to reduce energy intensity per product b y , or maintain the energy consumption index at 814 M\n\n2% compared to 2019 less than or equal to 2.\n\nJ per product.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nComply with rules and regulations, and establish an ISO 50001 energy management system working group to implement the company .

Stakeholders’ expectations should be assessed and analy zed at least once a year through engagement channels such as participatory hearing processes, satisfaction surveys, meetings, or other channels. Companies should use the results from these processes to develop appropriate methods of engagement to minimize risks of conflicts or sanctions against the business, such as boycotts on sales and purchases, sales of company shares, employee resignations, or protests.\n\n(3) Responding to stakeholder expectations Companies should summarize the primary methods, activities, projects,\n\nand communication channels that they use to engage with different stakeholders, such as opinion and satisfaction surveys and seminars. This information demonstrates that a company is regularly engaging with stakeholders and is committed to responding appropriately to the expectations of each stakeholder group and ensuring their satisfaction.\n\n28\n\nTable 1: Example of reporting on stakeholder engagement\n\nStakeholder Group\n\nExpectations\/ Needs\n\nExample of Response\n\nShareholders\n\nBusiness transparency and regular returns on investment\n\nDevelop an internal control system and efficient risk management\n\nTransparent disclosure of information through channels such as the annual shareholders meeting, annual report, and company website.\n\nEmployees\n\nFair compensation and career progression\n\nFair approach to compensation\n\nContinuous skills and capability development\n\nCustomers\n\nGood quality and appropriately priced products and services\n\nContinuous development of products and services\n\nFair pricing -\n\nAfter-sales services to respond to customers’ needs\n\nSuppliers\n\nFair and transparent procurement practices\n\nFair supplier practices and code of conduct for working together Development of suppliers’ skills and capabilities\n\nCommunities\/ Societies\n\nProtection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\nControl and minimization of environmental impacts from business operations - Support for community engagement and development activities, such as community career training\n\n29\n\nExample of Communication Channel\n\nShareholder meeting - Company website - Annual report\/ Sustainability report\n\nEmployee meetings - E-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nCompany website \/\n\nE-mail \/ Social media\n\nSales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations","Water management\n\nThis indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing negative environmental impacts through resource use efficiency. It also demonstrates a company’s commitment to reusing or recycling waste by bringing it back into business processes to create added value for the business.\n\nGreenhouse gas management This indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy and resource consumption across its value chain. These are significant contributors to the climate crisis and global warming, and will impact business operations in the future. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Brief overview of its environmental policy and guidelines, to show its approach to environmental management across the value chain. Policies may have similarities or differences from one another depending on the business context.\n\n2. Outcomes from the implementation of its environmental policy and guidelines, to ensure trust in how it manages energy and resources efficiently. In addition, a company should report on efforts to reduce its environmental impacts, as well as the number of incidents or cases of environmental incidents or violations, and explain the corrective measures taken (if any). 3. The value of fines or damages, in financial terms, resulting from environmental violations or incidents (if any), as well as the value of damages paid to individuals who were impacted by the company’s actions on the environment.\n\n4. How the company has applied environmental standards within its operational context in order to elevate the quality of environmental management. Note that some environmental standards, such as ISO 14001 and CDP, may be required for industries that have dealings with international markets and investments.\n\n5.

Data on energy consumption can show trends in a company’s electricity and\/or fuel use each year. If a company is consistently using more energy but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this may reveal that it has higher energy requirements.\n\nt\n\nRenewable energy consumption Renewable energy refers to energy sources such as sunlight, wind, and water, which can be naturally replenished. The use of renewable energy reflects a company’s commitment to reducing its reliance on non-renewable, fossil fuel-based energy, which will help to reduce the risk of future energy shortages and the volume of greenhouse gases emitted from its business processes. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and quantitative targets to reduce electricity and\/or fuel consumption,\n\ndemonstrating its commitment to improving energy use efficiency, reducing energy waste, and continuously improving its effectiveness in managing energy requirements.","Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies The Stock Exchange of Thailand\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe contents and information contained herein have been compiled for informational, educational and reference purposes only, the rights of which belong to The Stock Exchange of Thailand or a delegated authority (if applicable), under the protection of copyright laws.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies to disclose information concerning their environmental, social, and governance performance across their entire business value chain.\n\nForm 56-1 One Report\n\n2. Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has developed the Sustainability Reporting Guide for Listed Companies to provide them with a clear reporting framework and sustainability performance indicators that respond to the needs of investors and stakeholders in the Thai context. International Sustainability Reporting Guidelines\n\n3. There are various international sustainability reporting standards available, including the GRI Standards, Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework, and Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The Stock Exchange of Thailand encourages listed companies to voluntary disclose information according to these international standards, as appropriate.\n\n1 For more information, please refer to the Form 56-1 (One Report) Reporting \/ Annual Report Manual.\n\n9\n\n02\n\nAbout this Guide\n\nO\n\nb\n\njectives"],"response":"Establish a clear sustainability reporting scope aligned with the company's business nature and stakeholder impact.

Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report.

Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights\n\nS2 Fair Labor Practices S3 Responsibility to Customers\/Consumers S4 Responsibility to Communities\/Societies\n\nGovernance and Economic Dimension (G) G1 Policy, Structure and Governance System\n\nG2 Sustainability Policy and Strategy G3 Sustainability Risk Management G4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G5 Innovation Development\n\nExplanation\n\nBusiness activities can impact the qualities of life and human rights of many groups of stakeholders. To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic. These should align with the objectives and targets that they have set for that material topic and include the following:\n\n4.3.2","Sales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management. They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations","2.

A sustainable supply chain management process considers environmental and social impacts and good governance, as this will help to mitigate business impacts from issues such as illegal labor and corruption. It also indicates that a company is committed to building relationships with its suppliers and to develop the business while delivering positive results for the economy, society and environment, for example through continuous supplier capacity development and green procurement.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key aspects of its sustainable supply chain management policy and guidelines, or the Supplier Code of Conduct (if applicable), to demonstrate that the company has criteria for procurement covering environmental, social, and good governance practices. Examples include environmentally-friendly procurement of raw materials, products and services, and the prohibition of child or slave labor.\n\n2. Key aspects of the company’s supply chain management plan and clearly defined targets. These plans may cover mitigation measures for supplier-related economic risks (e.g., over- reliance on a small group of suppliers, receiving poor quality products\/services), social issues (e.g., human rights violations, unethical conduct towards employee and laborers), and environmental issues (e.g., environmental law violations).\n\n3. Percentage of new suppliers that passed the supplier screening criteria covering environmental, social, and good governance issues.\n\n4. Percentage of key suppliers acknowledging the company’s supplier code of conduct.

It consists of two levels of indicators:\n\n1. Core (C) Indicators","20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.\n\nPresentation techniques Companies should present quantitative and qualitative information using language that is concise and easy to understand, and use formats such as infographics, diagrams, tables, and images in an organized way. This will help to stimulate interest for readers, make content easier to memorize, and enhance communications efficiency.\n\n3.\n\n21\n\n04\n\nElements of Sustainability Reporting\n\n4.1 Part 1:\n\nEssential Information\n\nCompanies should provide an overview of their business operations, as this will help information users to understand their operational context and the business activities that affect stakeholders. Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions. Examples include pricing, advertisements, and announcements.\n\nCustomer Services Activities related to enhancing customer satisfaction after sales, to retain customers for the repeat purchases of products and services. Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","(2) Stakeholder expectations Companies should briefly explain the expectations and needs of each\n\nstakeholder group, for example:\n\nStakeholder Group Shareholders\n\nEmployees\n\nCustomers\n\nSuppliers\n\nCommunities\/Societies\n\nExpectations\/Needs Business transparency and regular returns on investment Fair compensation and career progression Good quality and appropriately priced products and services Fair and transparent procurement practices Protection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\n27\n\nWhen reporting on stakeholder expectations, companies should show how their business activities are linked to each stakeholder group. Stakeholders’ expectations should be assessed and analy zed at least once a year through engagement channels such as participatory hearing processes, satisfaction surveys, meetings, or other channels. Companies should use the results from these processes to develop appropriate methods of engagement to minimize risks of conflicts or sanctions against the business, such as boycotts on sales and purchases, sales of company shares, employee resignations, or protests.\n\n(3) Responding to stakeholder expectations Companies should summarize the primary methods, activities, projects,\n\nand communication channels that they use to engage with different stakeholders, such as opinion and satisfaction surveys and seminars. This information demonstrates that a company is regularly engaging with stakeholders and is committed to responding appropriately to the expectations of each stakeholder group and ensuring their satisfaction.\n\n28\n\nTable 1: Example of reporting on stakeholder engagement\n\nStakeholder Group\n\nExpectations\/ Needs\n\nExample of Response\n\nShareholders\n\nBusiness transparency and regular returns on investment\n\nDevelop an internal control system and efficient risk management\n\nTransparent disclosure of information through channels such as the annual shareholders meeting, annual report, and company website.\n\nEmployees\n\nFair compensation and career progression\n\nFair approach to compensation\n\nContinuous skills and capability development\n\nCustomers\n\nGood quality and appropriately priced products and services\n\nContinuous development of products and services\n\nFair pricing -\n\nAfter-sales services to respond to customers’ needs\n\nSuppliers\n\nFair and transparent procurement practices\n\nFair supplier practices and code of conduct for working together Development of suppliers’ skills and capabilities\n\nCommunities\/ Societies\n\nProtection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\nControl and minimization of environmental impacts from business operations - Support for community engagement and development activities, such as community career training\n\n29\n\nExample of Communication Channel\n\nShareholder meeting - Company website - Annual report\/ Sustainability report\n\nEmployee meetings - E-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nCompany website \/\n\nE-mail \/ Social media\n\nSales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management. They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach.

These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders.

These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.","20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.\n\nPresentation techniques Companies should present quantitative and qualitative information using language that is concise and easy to understand, and use formats such as infographics, diagrams, tables, and images in an organized way. This will help to stimulate interest for readers, make content easier to memorize, and enhance communications efficiency.\n\n3.\n\n21\n\n04\n\nElements of Sustainability Reporting\n\n4.1 Part 1:\n\nEssential Information\n\nCompanies should provide an overview of their business operations, as this will help information users to understand their operational context and the business activities that affect stakeholders. Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions. Examples include pricing, advertisements, and announcements.\n\nCustomer Services Activities related to enhancing customer satisfaction after sales, to retain customers for the repeat purchases of products and services. Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic. These should align with the objectives and targets that they have set for that material topic and include the following:\n\n4.3.2\n\n(1) Resource allocation, e.g., who is the responsible owner, the equipment,\n\ntools, machinery, and capital used;\n\n(2) Protection and remediation measures in cases of problems or obstacles;\n\nand\n\n(3) How it is engaging relevant stakeholders.\n\nIndicators and Performance Companies should report performance that is measurable, and evaluate their performance on each material topic using clear performance indicators. This will enable companies to see their progress against targets and ensure that their sustainability journeys are effective and ongoing.\n\n4.3.3\n\n36\n\nTable 4: Example of how to report a management approach for a material topic\n\nMaterial Topic\n\nObjectives and Targets\n\nEnergy Management ’s energy consumption to ensure highest efficiency\n\nManage the company Consider efficient natural resource use, reduce environmental impacts and energy costs.\n\nThe company\n\n’s 2020 target is to reduce energy intensity per product b y , or maintain the energy consumption index at 814 M\n\n2% compared to 2019 less than or equal to 2.\n\nJ per product.\n\nManagement Approach\n\nComply with rules and regulations, and establish an ISO 50001 energy management system working group to implement the company .

If internal subject matter experts are lacking, has the appointment of external parties to evaluate the effectiveness of the board been considered?\n\niii. Are any steps taken to ensure board members are well equipped with knowledge on climate risks and opportunities, and that climate awareness survives through succession\/ leaving of vocal climate champions?\n\n| 12\n\nClimate Scenario Analysis\n\nPurpose\n\nScenario analysis is an exercise recommended by the TCFD to help companies effectively identify and assess the potential business implications of climate-related risks and opportunities from a range of plausible future conditions. Scenarios are hypothetical pathways of development that consider how the future might look if certain trends continue or certain conditions are met. It is important to note that scenarios are hypothetical constructs intended to explore alternatives that may significantly alter the basis for ‘business-as-usual’ assumptions; they are not an exercise in forecasts, predictions, nor are they sensitivity analysis.\n\nGuiding principles\n\n1. The scope and boundaries of scenario analysis should represent a company’s material business operations.\n\nSmaller companies may consider an analysis of their direct operations to be sufficient, while larger","(2) Stakeholder expectations Companies should briefly explain the expectations and needs of each\n\nstakeholder group, for example:\n\nStakeholder Group Shareholders\n\nEmployees\n\nCustomers\n\nSuppliers\n\nCommunities\/Societies\n\nExpectations\/Needs Business transparency and regular returns on investment Fair compensation and career progression Good quality and appropriately priced products and services Fair and transparent procurement practices Protection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\n27\n\nWhen reporting on stakeholder expectations, companies should show how their business activities are linked to each stakeholder group. Stakeholders’ expectations should be assessed and analy zed at least once a year through engagement channels such as participatory hearing processes, satisfaction surveys, meetings, or other channels. Companies should use the results from these processes to develop appropriate methods of engagement to minimize risks of conflicts or sanctions against the business, such as boycotts on sales and purchases, sales of company shares, employee resignations, or protests.\n\n(3) Responding to stakeholder expectations Companies should summarize the primary methods, activities, projects,\n\nand communication channels that they use to engage with different stakeholders, such as opinion and satisfaction surveys and seminars. This information demonstrates that a company is regularly engaging with stakeholders and is committed to responding appropriately to the expectations of each stakeholder group and ensuring their satisfaction.\n\n28\n\nTable 1: Example of reporting on stakeholder engagement\n\nStakeholder Group\n\nExpectations\/ Needs\n\nExample of Response\n\nShareholders\n\nBusiness transparency and regular returns on investment\n\nDevelop an internal control system and efficient risk management\n\nTransparent disclosure of information through channels such as the annual shareholders meeting, annual report, and company website.\n\nEmployees\n\nFair compensation and career progression\n\nFair approach to compensation\n\nContinuous skills and capability development\n\nCustomers\n\nGood quality and appropriately priced products and services\n\nContinuous development of products and services\n\nFair pricing -\n\nAfter-sales services to respond to customers’ needs\n\nSuppliers\n\nFair and transparent procurement practices\n\nFair supplier practices and code of conduct for working together Development of suppliers’ skills and capabilities\n\nCommunities\/ Societies\n\nProtection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\nControl and minimization of environmental impacts from business operations - Support for community engagement and development activities, such as community career training\n\n29\n\nExample of Communication Channel\n\nShareholder meeting - Company website - Annual report\/ Sustainability report\n\nEmployee meetings - E-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nCompany website \/\n\nE-mail \/ Social media\n\nSales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management.

Financial reporting, in particular, demonstrates a business’s profitability, but this alone may not be sufficient for investors’ decision-making. This is because businesses today must encounter increasingly complex economic, social, and environmental risks and challenges.\n\nAs a result, a company’s non-financial information, such as its vision, mission, strategy and risk factors, and especially environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, are as essential for investment decisions as financial information. It will not only help stakeholders to understand the various dimensions of a company’s operations in a more holistic way, but also increase stakeholders’ confidence in the long-term potential of the business.\n\nBenefits of Sustainability Reporting\n\n1. Companies will have access to ESG information to make decisions about the business or for organizational development. By providing information that reflects long-term business potential, companies will also have the opportunity to attract high-quality investors, who can create added value for the business.\n\n2. Investors will have access to diverse and comprehensive information for their investment decisions.\n\n3. Securities professionals will have access to information to analyze the risks and opportunities of investing in a business that performs in compliance with ESG standards.\n\n4. Stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies and sustainability assessors, will have access to ESG information to help them establish relevant policies and promote sustainable practices across sectors.\n\n8\n\nSustainability Disclosure Guidelines in the Thai Capital Market\n\n1\n\n1.

Material\n\nCompanies should report sustainability information that is material and aligns with their organizational strategy and stakeholders’ needs. The content should be concise, accurate, and easy to understand. Companies should avoid disclosing large quantities of information without considering the needs of information users.\n\n2. Timely\n\nCompanies should report information that is current and regularly update\n\nthe information to demonstrate their progress.\n\n3. Reliable\n\nCompanies should report information that is accurate, complete and impartial\n\nso that users can trust in the information received.\n\n4. Comparable\n\nCompanies should present quantitative information that show trends in their sustainability performance up to the present day, which can be compared with competitors and other businesses in the industry.\n\n18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2.

Factors to consider:\n\ni. Is the management style and culture of your company more conducive to a collaborative approach, or specialized approach?\n\nii. Do existing committees have the requisite expertise to scrutinize climate risks and opportunities?\n\niii. Is there capacity for existing committees to expand their scope of work into climate- related efforts, in terms of leadership, time and resources?\n\n2\n\nBoard member(s) responsible for climate change issues should be in positions that will allow them to influence board decisions (eg committee chairs).\n\n{\tCompany X: The Corporate Governance Committee and Risk Management Committee,\n\nwhich comprises of four board members, have direct responsibility over approval of near- and long-term climate targets, renewable energy projects and internal carbon pricing mechanisms.

{"user_input":"how company help communities and make good jobs?","retrieved_contexts":["Conflicts with communities This describes a company’s ability to build relationships with communities and comply with relevant laws, such as those relating to community rights, human rights, and the environment. Furthermore, it demonstrates whether a company effectively handles community grievances to within manageable levels and prevents incidents from deteriorating to the extent that they interrupt business operations, or stop projects entirely. If a company has an increasing number of community conflicts or worsening trends, this reflects the possibility that its business capabilities will decrease, and that it could face higher costs associated with conflict mitigation and resolution.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key information on its community\/social policy, which demonstrates a commitment and\n\nresponsibility to protecting and reducing the impacts of its business operations on communities\/ societies, as well as guidelines or mitigation measures to address community\/social impacts. Note that this information could also be part of a company’s human rights policy and guidelines. 2. Target for developing and engaging with communities that may be affected by the business. Companies should disclose quantitative, comparable and measurable targets, for example, a reduction in the number of complaints or conflicts with communities that are caused by business activities or operations.\n\n3. Community\/social development plans that align with the company’s business context, such as:\n\nCommunity satisfaction surveys, used for developing approaches that respond to the needs of both the community and business.\n\nAnalysis of benefits that the community and company receive from community development efforts, or projects that address social issues.\n\nSupporting sustainable, self-sufficient communities by using business resources, capabilities and capacities to strengthen and elevate their qualities of life.\n\n4. Benefits from community\/social development projects or activities. This is to demonstrate the outcomes and effectiveness of a company’s community development plans. A company can disclose these benefits in financial terms, such as increased income per household, or non- financial terms, such as increase in the number of local suppliers.\n\n5.

Companies should communicate the impacts of their products and\/or services to customers, users or consumers in a complete and accurate way, so that these stakeholders can be confident that the company is using its marketing tools responsibly. This will help to reduce the risks of trade barriers and create opportunities for a company to build long-term consumer brand loyalty.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key summary of its marketing and sales guidelines, and performance against plans. These\n\nshould show that a company is aware of the impacts of its marketing communications tools on customers\/consumers, and that it does not support advertising or sales promotion activities that promote illegal or immoral conduct.\n\n2. Measures and outcomes of communicating about its products or services in a transparent and comprehensive way, to help consumers make decisions. A company may present information or warnings about the use of a product and\/or service through user manuals, product labels or packaging. Additionally, a company should not communicate information about its products or services in ways that are unrealistic or misleading.

It also demonstrates a company’s efforts to improving living standards and extending benefits to those in the community\/society, ensuring that they continue to have good qualities of life.\n\nConflicts with communities This describes a company’s ability to build relationships with communities and comply with relevant laws, such as those relating to community rights, human rights, and the environment. Furthermore, it demonstrates whether a company effectively handles community grievances to within manageable levels and prevents incidents from deteriorating to the extent that they interrupt business operations, or stop projects entirely. If a company has an increasing number of community conflicts or worsening trends, this reflects the possibility that its business capabilities will decrease, and that it could face higher costs associated with conflict mitigation and resolution.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key information on its community\/social policy, which demonstrates a commitment and","Respect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.\n\nGreenhouse gas management is part of national and global collaboration efforts to tackle the global warming and climate change crisis, which are leading causes of natural disasters.\n\n…Additional topics\n\n… (Specify details)\n\n… (Specify details)\n\n32\n\n4.2.3 Prioritization of Material Topics\n\nCompanies will not be able to address each of their material topics at the same time.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2

Structure and Governance System\n\nG2 Sustainability Policy and Strategy G3 Sustainability Risk Management G4 Sustainable Supply Chain Management G5 Innovation Development\n\nExplanation\n\nBusiness activities can impact the qualities of life and human rights of many groups of stakeholders. To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic. These should align with the objectives and targets that they have set for that material topic and include the following:\n\n4.3.2","Sales representative\n\nSupplier meetings - Company website - Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nSeminars and activities with communities in areas surrounding factories\n\nE-mail \/ Social media \/ Intranet\n\nLocal newspapers\n\n4.2 Part 2:\n\nSustainability Policy and Strategy\n\nA sustainability policy and strategy describe a company’s overall aim and strategic approach to sustainability management. They comprise the following key components.\n\n4.2.1 Sustainability Policy and Targets\n\nA sustainability policy and targets describe a company’s direction and\n\napproach to sustainability, and are made up of:\n\n(1) Objectives and Targets A company’s strategic direction and expectations for sustainability. These cover environmental and social issues under the framework of robust corporate governance.\n\n(2) Approach\n\nProcesses, methods or standards that enable a company to implement sustainability in a tangible way. This approach should demonstrate how a company will meet its objectives and targets set out in point (1).\n\nIn addition, a company should report on its progress and performance, and demonstrate that it is regularly reviewing key policy issues annually, to ensure that they remain aligned with organizational strategy. By doing this, stakeholders can be confident that a company is implementing these policies effectively.\n\n30\n\n4.2.2 Material Sustainability Topics\n\nMaterial topics are important issues that a company must prioritize in order to achieve the targets set out in its sustainability policy. These material topics reflect both business risks and opportunities, and can be identified from the following factors:\n\n(1) Factors affecting the business\n\n(2) Factors affecting stakeholders\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that impact their ability to generate revenue and grow the business. Examples include strategy, finance, operations, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n\nCompanies should consider the economic, social, and environmental issues that could either benefit or negatively impact stakeholders. Such issues should also relate to business impacts and be of interest to stakeholders.\n\n31\n\nTable 2: Example of reporting on material topics\n\nExample of Material Topic\n\nBusiness\n\nFactors that affect:\n\nStakeholders\n\nOrganizational risk management\n\nA corporate governance and risk management system that has measures for protection, resolution, and remediation, and which cover economic, social and environmental issues, will result in stakeholder trust ’s internal control system. in a company\n\nEfficient risk management measures will help prepare the business for new opportunities, as well as mitigate impacts from economic, social or environmental issues.\n\nRisk management mitigates the impacts of a company ’s operations on stakeholders. For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business.

In addition, data on the number of employees can reveal whether an organization’s size and structure are appropriately suited to its needs. For example, reporting on the number of employees by age group shows that a company possesses experiences across different generations. However, if there are too many younger employees, the business may be lacking in experienced personnel, whereas if there are too many employees close to retirement, the business risks facing a labor shortage. This information is important for helping a company to prepare its human resources for the future. Furthermore, data on employees across different categories can demonstrate workforce diversity in terms of gender, age, roles and responsibilities and geographies, and this can help to foster opportunities for persons with disabilities\n\n5 and the elderly.6\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1.

Responding to the expectations of these various stakeholder groups regularly will help companies build satisfaction and reduce the risks of conflicts with stakeholders. Companies can report information about their stakeholders through a variety of formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions.\n\n(1) Stakeholder group Companies should specify the groups of people who are impacted positively and negatively by their business operations, such as shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, regulatory agencies, communities and the wider society. To determine who their stakeholders are, companies should consider factors such as the stakeholder’s relationship, role, and influence on the business, as well as the local geography and community livelihoods that may be affected by the business. This will be helpful to determine the most appropriate methods and approaches for engaging with these stakeholders.\n\n(2) Stakeholder expectations Companies should briefly explain the expectations and needs of each\n\nstakeholder group, for example:\n\nStakeholder Group Shareholders\n\nEmployees\n\nCustomers\n\nSuppliers\n\nCommunities\/Societies\n\nExpectations\/Needs Business transparency and regular returns on investment Fair compensation and career progression Good quality and appropriately priced products and services Fair and transparent procurement practices Protection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\n27"],"response":"Companies can help communities and create good jobs by developing community engagement policies and social development plans that address the needs of both the communities and the business.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

Companies should communicate the impacts of their products and\/or services to customers, users or consumers in a complete and accurate way, so that these stakeholders can be confident that the company is using its marketing tools responsibly. This will help to reduce the risks of trade barriers and create opportunities for a company to build long-term consumer brand loyalty.\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Key summary of its marketing and sales guidelines, and performance against plans. These\n\nshould show that a company is aware of the impacts of its marketing communications tools on customers\/consumers, and that it does not support advertising or sales promotion activities that promote illegal or immoral conduct.\n\n2. Measures and outcomes of communicating about its products or services in a transparent and comprehensive way, to help consumers make decisions. A company may present information or warnings about the use of a product and\/or service through user manuals, product labels or packaging.

For example, it builds suppliers’ trust in a transparent procurement process, ensures that customers receive safe and high- quality products and services, and that communities will not encounter environmental impacts from business operations.\n\nRespect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.","(2) Stakeholder expectations Companies should briefly explain the expectations and needs of each\n\nstakeholder group, for example:\n\nStakeholder Group Shareholders\n\nEmployees\n\nCustomers\n\nSuppliers\n\nCommunities\/Societies\n\nExpectations\/Needs Business transparency and regular returns on investment Fair compensation and career progression Good quality and appropriately priced products and services Fair and transparent procurement practices Protection against environmental impacts, and support for community activities\n\n27\n\nWhen reporting on stakeholder expectations, companies should show how their business activities are linked to each stakeholder group.

In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1.

These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers.

The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","2.

In cases of consumer rights violations, companies should demonstrate that they have an approach for managing the complaint and have put in place mitigation measures for the affected consumers, ensuring that they are treated fairly.\n\nPromoting customer engagement This demonstrates a company’s ongoing commitment to responding to customers’ expectations and building relationships, which will help to build customers’ trust in the company’s products and services. Through this approach, companies can also retain customers and identify opportunities to build new customer bases. In addition, companies should assess customer satisfaction to understand whether customers accept their products and services; that their experiences match their expectations, and whether the company’s products\/services are effective, as all of this has an impact on business growth. Finally, companies should use the outcomes of their customer engagement to improve on their approach to customer relations and enhancing customer satisfaction.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management.

For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.\n\nPresentation techniques Companies should present quantitative and qualitative information using language that is concise and easy to understand, and use formats such as infographics, diagrams, tables, and images in an organized way. This will help to stimulate interest for readers, make content easier to memorize, and enhance communications efficiency.\n\n3.\n\n21\n\n04\n\nElements of Sustainability Reporting\n\n4.1 Part 1:\n\nEssential Information\n\nCompanies should provide an overview of their business operations, as this will help information users to understand their operational context and the business activities that affect stakeholders. Essential information includes the following:\n\nBusiness model Provide an overview of the objectives, targets and business models that create economic, social, and environmental value for the company and its stakeholders. Examples include the company’s vision, business structure, types of products and services, capital, intellectual property and organizational strategy.\n\n4.1.1\n\n4.1.2\n\nBusiness value chain Explain the activities that create added value for the business, from\n\nupstream to downstream. These activities include:\n\n(1) Primary activities Business activities that generate revenue or capital for the company, from raw material sourcing and fundraising to the manufacturing and distribution of products and services, and customer retention. If a company understands the nature of its primary activities, it will be able to efficiently allocate its resources and recognize how stakeholders can benefit from them. Companies can report this information through formats that are best suited to their needs and easy to understand, such as through text descriptions, graphs or images with captions, as per the following example.\n\n24\n\nManagement of Production Factors or Inbound Logistics\n\nActivities related to the sourcing, receiving, procurement and management of resources that are production factors. Examples of such factors include land, labor, capital, and raw materials. In the case of financial institutions, this may include sources of capital and loans.\n\nOperations\n\nActivities related to the conversion of production factors into products and services that are delivered to customers. Examples include manufacturing, services, packaging, or quality control.\n\nProduct and Service Distribution or Outbound Logistics Activities related to the management of purchase orders, logistics, sales, inventory, and the management of product and service lists to distribute or deliver products and services to customers.\n\nMarketing and Sales\n\nActivities related to marketing promotions that encourage customers, service users or consumers to make purchasing decisions. Examples include pricing, advertisements, and announcements.\n\nCustomer Services Activities related to enhancing customer satisfaction after sales, to retain customers for the repeat purchases of products and services. Examples include product installation and verification services, warranty and maintenance services, among others.\n\n25","18\n\nSustainability Reporting Scope\n\nEstablishing the scope of a sustainability report is important in helping\n\ncompanies to create a clear framework for report development, which will facilitate the data collection and report writing process. Companies can determine their reporting scope b on the following factors:\n\ny looking at what is most appropriate for their business, based\n\n1. Nature of business\n\nCompanies can outline their reporting scope b\n\ny starting with the main\n\n. In the case where a company has many subsidiaries business, or parent company or is a holding company , the scope could first focus on companies with the highest shareholdings and\/or that have the most impact on stakeholders. Once a company is more accustomed to sustainability reporting, it can steadily expand the reporting scope to include other businesses.\n\n2. Location of operations\n\nCompanies can consider the location of their operations to determine their reporting scope. For example, companies can define the scope based on distance from their operational site or office, the key stakeholders in the area, or other physical risks, such as a factory being located in a drought-affected area. In the case where a company has operations in many locations, the area size or facility can be considered.\n\n19\n\nSustainability Reporting Stages\n\nSustainability reporting is not the responsibility of one particular department within an organization. Rather, it is the responsibility of all departments. To ensure that the sustainability reporting process is systematic and of the highest quality, companies should adopt the following approach:\n\nStage\n\nDescription\n\nPlanning\n\nSet up a working group that will be responsible for preparing the sustainability information and report.\n\nDevelop a plan and budget for the sustainability report. - Define the reporting scope based on the business value chain. - Explore and analyze stakeholders’ expectations. - Analyze and identify the material sustainability topics that will serve as a structure for the report.\n\nEstablish sustainability policies and performance indicators.\n\nImplementation\n\nOrganize meetings and discussions with relevant departments to compile information for the report. Companies should ensure that this becomes a part of regular performance monitoring under their organizational strategy. - Collect and store sustainability information according to the targets and indicators set by the organization.\n\nDraft the sustainability report.\n\nReview\n\nReview, screen, and verify the accuracy of the sustainability information disclosed by internal departments and\/or external agencies.\n\nPresent the information or sustainability report to the Executive Committee or company management for approval prior to public distribution.\n\nDisseminate the sustainability information and report to stakeholders through easily accessible channels.\n\nContinuous Development\n\nRegularly monitor and improve sustainability performance after the sustainability information or report has been published, and\/or based on recommendations from stakeholders.\n\n20\n\nCommunicating Sustainability Information and the Report\n\n1. Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2.

Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.","Respect for human rights\n\nMeasures to protect and remedy human rights issues will help a company to reduce the risk of human rights violations in their business activities, for example the risk of employing illegal labor or conflicts with stakeholders. These issues could severely damage the business, and lead to repercussions such as trade barriers.\n\nHuman rights governance and compliance with human rights policies will enable a company to fairly protect the rights of their stakeholders. As a result, employees and laborers will be treated fairly ; customers will be able to access safe and high- quality products and services.\n\nGreenhouse gas management\n\nGreenhouse gas management demonstrates a company ’s ability to , use energy and resources efficiently reduce costs, and create added value for the business. Examples of measures include reducing electricity and fuel consumption in the manufacturing and logistics process, and developing low carbon products, among others.\n\nGreenhouse gas management is part of national and global collaboration efforts to tackle the global warming and climate change crisis, which are leading causes of natural disasters.\n\n…Additional topics\n\n… (Specify details)\n\n… (Specify details)\n\n32\n\n4.2.3 Prioritization of Material Topics\n\nCompanies will not be able to address each of their material topics at the same time. Because of this, they should prioritize the issues and report on their method for prioritization. This will help companies to decide which material topics to address in order of importance and urgency, and how best to manage them.\n\nImage 2:\n\nMethod for prioritizing material topics: Materiality matrix\n\nHigh\n\nImpact to the business “Low – Moderate”\n\nImpact to the business “High”\n\ns r e d l o h e k a t s\n\ng n i t c a p m\n\nImpact to stakeholders “High”\n\nImpact to the business “Low – Moderate”\n\nImpact to stakeholders “High”\n\nImpact to the business “High”\n\ni\n\ns e u s s I\n\nImpact to stakeholders “Low – Moderate”\n\nImpact to stakeholders “Low - Moderate”\n\nLow\n\nIssues impacting the business\n\nHigh\n\n33\n\n4.2.4\n\nMaterial Sustainability Topics for All Industries Following a review of material sustainability topics from local and\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand has\n\ninternational sustainability standards, identified the material environmental, social, governance and economic topics that companies should report on below.\n\nTable 3:\n\nMaterial sustainability topics for companies recommended by\n\nThe Stock Exchange of Thailand\n\nEnvironmental Dimension (E) E1 Environmental Policy and Compliance Standards E2 Energy Management\n\nE3 Water Management E4 Waste Management\n\nE5 Greenhouse Gas Management\n\nExplanation\n\nAn environmental policy outlines a company’s approach to energy management and resource use efficiency, which are essential for businesses in any industry.\n\nThe efficient sourcing and consumption of electricity, fossil fuels, and other energy sources show that a company is effectively managing costs and putting in efforts to reduce their reliance on wasteful and non-renewable energy sources. The efficient sourcing and consumption of water show that a company is managing costs in its business processes and reducing the risks of water shortages. Efforts to reduce waste from business operations demonstrate a company’s ability to use resources efficiently, as well as its efforts to reduce the potential negative impacts of its business processes on communities and societies. Efforts to control and continuously reduce greenhouse gas emissions will help a company to mitigate the impacts and severity of climate change and natural disasters on its business activities.\n\n2 The Stock Exchange of Thailand’s review of sustainability management approaches includes local and global guidelines that align with the Form 56-1 One Report\/Annual Report, national strategy, Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (2017), GRI Standards, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and national and international sustainability performance assessments.\n\n34\n\nSocial Dimension (S) S1 Human Rights","Water management\n\nThis indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing negative environmental impacts through resource use efficiency. It also demonstrates a company’s commitment to reusing or recycling waste by bringing it back into business processes to create added value for the business.\n\nGreenhouse gas management This indicates that a company has a commitment and approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy and resource consumption across its value chain. These are significant contributors to the climate crisis and global warming, and will impact business operations in the future. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Brief overview of its environmental policy and guidelines, to show its approach to environmental management across the value chain. Policies may have similarities or differences from one another depending on the business context.\n\n2. Outcomes from the implementation of its environmental policy and guidelines, to ensure trust in how it manages energy and resources efficiently. In addition, a company should report on efforts to reduce its environmental impacts, as well as the number of incidents or cases of environmental incidents or violations, and explain the corrective measures taken (if any). 3. The value of fines or damages, in financial terms, resulting from environmental violations or incidents (if any), as well as the value of damages paid to individuals who were impacted by the company’s actions on the environment.\n\n4. How the company has applied environmental standards within its operational context in order to elevate the quality of environmental management. Note that some environmental standards, such as ISO 14001 and CDP, may be required for industries that have dealings with international markets and investments.\n\n5.

Data on energy consumption can show trends in a company’s electricity and\/or fuel use each year. If a company is consistently using more energy but its growth or expansion rate remains the same, this may reveal that it has higher energy requirements.\n\nt\n\nRenewable energy consumption Renewable energy refers to energy sources such as sunlight, wind, and water, which can be naturally replenished. The use of renewable energy reflects a company’s commitment to reducing its reliance on non-renewable, fossil fuel-based energy, which will help to reduce the risk of future energy shortages and the volume of greenhouse gases emitted from its business processes. Reporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Management plans and quantitative targets to reduce electricity and\/or fuel consumption,\n\ndemonstrating its commitment to improving energy use efficiency, reducing energy waste, and continuously improving its effectiveness in managing energy requirements."],"response":"Companies can effectively integrate sustainability into their supply chain management by developing a comprehensive sustainable supply chain management policy that includes criteria for procurement covering environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices.

An effective risk response implementation plan should be incorporated into business strategy at the company level. For example, a company considers achieving net-zero by 2050 as a risk response to climate risks. This overarching target should be supported and incorporated into the overall business strategy, which would involve actions and support from different levels of the company. Metrics should be developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan ahead of the execution stage.\n\nExecute the plan and monitor its effectiveness\n\nA designated team with well-defined responsibilities should execute the plan according to the timeline, report progress to management and monitor the effectiveness of the plan on a regular basis. In order to effectively execute the implementation plan, regular reviewing and monitoring of the plan is essential.

The team may\n\ninvolve personnel from different departments and regions across the organization. The\n\nteam works together to develop measures and plans to address specific risks based on\n\nthe risk response chosen. The planning process would provoke discussion about how the\n\nmeasures and plans should be supported by the overall business strategy. This facilitates\n\nthe consideration and integration of climate risks in business strategy planning.\n\nCompany X identified carbon pricing as a material transition risk as it operates energy-\n\nintensive manufacturing sites in different regions like the UK, EU, US and China. Each\n\nregion is subjected to different carbon pricing policies. The risk owner chooses “reduce”\n\nas the risk response to address the risk of carbon pricing.

Reporting on TCFD recommendations Guidance on Climate Disclosures","The report then highlights and expands on three key areas of TCFD implementation, namely governance, climate scenario analysis and climate risk management. The purpose of this section is to provide practical guidance to companies who are looking to implement TCFD recommendations within their organization.\n\nThis report consolidates some examples of good practices, which are inspired by real-world use cases. These examples are used to illustrate how the TCFD recommendations are implemented and provide insights to companies to develop their own strategy and approach. The case studies and examples included in this report do not demonstrate the only approach to implementing the TCFD recommendations, but rather serve as examples to illustrate how they have been implemented in practice, which provides companies with a point of reference. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and companies should adapt the TCFD recommendations to their unique organizational context.\n\n| 3\n\nInterdependencies of the TCFD Pillars\n\nThe diagram below shows the interdependencies between all four TCFD pillars and highlights the importance of reporting. The TCFD pillars are governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\nA well-established governance structure can ensure that climate issues are addressed across the organization as a matter of priority and in an effective manner. It is a prerequisite to effectively identifying, assessing and managing a wide spectrum of climate issues, as well as formulating an ambitious and practical climate strategy.\n\nRisk management is too often seen as a compliance exercise and not truly integrated with business strategy, objectives and decision-making. To effectively address climate challenges, business strategy should take climate-related issues into consideration. Through the climate risk identification and assessment exercise, companies can identify climate risks that are material to their business and choose the appropriate risk response to address those issues. However, adopting a risk response that is not aligned with the business strategy is ineffective to address climate risks. Climate risk responses that are in line with overall business strategies can ensure all levels of the company are working together to achieve a common goal.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of climate reporting is often underestimated by companies. It is worthwhile to note that reporting is an important tool to communicate a company’s performance and actions against climate-related issues. By disclosing climate-related issues in a transparent way, companies can receive valuable feedback from their internal and external stakeholders, including investors, on how they can further improve their climate governance, strategy, and risk management. Companies can then evaluate their approach and strategy on climate-related issues and update their stakeholders on any significant changes, forming an effective feedback loop.\n\nStrategy\n\nFeedback\n\nGovernance\n\nReporting\n\nClimate risk management (metrics and targets)\n\nClimate risk identiﬁcation and assessment\n\nFeedback\n\n| 4\n\nTCFD Journey Roadmap - identify your stage in the environmental journey\n\nThe TCFD roadmap, which is shown in the table below, describes the characteristics of four different environmental stages, namely early, developing, mature and best practice, based on the four TCFD pillars.

For instance,","| 21\n\nCase study – Climate Risk Assessment and Prioritization\n\nThe risks in the climate risk inventory are assessed by Company X’s expert team in terms\n\nof likelihood, time horizon, financial impact and response to risk. Company X has its own\n\ndefinition of time horizon. Short-term is defined as less than one year. Mid-term is defined as\n\nmore than one year but less than three years. Long-term is defined as three to nine years.\n\nCompany X forms an expert team, which includes representatives from different teams\n\nsuch as Sustainability, Procurement, Finance, Operations, Marketing and an external\n\nexpert on climate issues. The expert team is responsible for identifying climate risks and\n\nassessing the risks. A primary screening is conducted to remove risks that fall behind the\n\nlong-term time horizon, or that fall within the time horizon but are below the financial\n\nmateriality threshold of US$50 million.\n\nThe primary screening results of the assessment are shared with C-suite executives and\n\nsenior management across different departments for discussion and, when relevant,\n\ncomplementary works to update the first assessment done. Once all relevant parties have\n\nvalidated the climate-related risks assessed, the Strategy Planning Department includes\n\nthe risks in the climate risk inventory and goes through the annual company risk integration\n\nprocess, which involves further assessment of the climate risks validated and integrates into\n\nthe existing enterprise risk management system. The Risk Management team leads different\n\ndepartments to conduct the in-depth risk assessment exercise, quantifying and qualifying\n\nthe impacts and likelihood of the risks. The risk management result, incorporated with\n\nclimate risks, is reported to the Executive Committee and Audit Committee, which is involved\n\nin the risk prioritization process and evaluation of business strategy and objectives.\n\n| 22\n\nC.

He or she holds the accountability of managing and monitoring the risk assigned as well as reporting to the senior management or the board. The risk owner shall assemble a cross-functional team to effectively support risk management plan development, implementation and monitoring progress.\n\nChoose risk responses\n\nRisk owners and their cross-functional teams shall select appropriate risk responses for those material risks identified. According to the COSO ERM Framework, risk responses fall within the categories of accept, avoid, pursue, reduce and share.

To treat all stakeholders fairly, companies must first demonstrate an understanding of their stakeholders, adopt a positive mindset in their conduct, and operate in a way that does not violate human rights. The fair treatment of employees – from recruitment to retirement – demonstrates that a company is committed to engaging and building relationships with its employees. This also helps to reduce the risk of labor conflicts. Responsibility to customers and consumers is about a company’s commitment to offering reliable products and\/or services that increase their satisfaction and trust.\n\nResponsibility to communities and societies is about a company’s commitment to protecting them from negative business impacts. In addition, by regularly engaging in community\/social development activities, companies are demonstrating their dedication to sustainably improving the qualities of life of people in society.\n\nExplanation\n\nA good corporate governance structure and management system are indicators that a company has internal control mechanisms that promote fairness and transparency. The system and structure should also stipulate how the Board of Directors and leadership will lead the organization towards success, as well as consider benefits to shareholders and responsibility to stakeholders. An organization’s sustainability policy and strategy are indicators of its commitment to sustainable business governance and growth, alongside social and environmental progress.\n\nAn approach to risk and opportunity management for economic, social and environmental changes reveals whether a company has an adequate internal control system. This will help stakeholders to have confidence in a company’s ability to respond to and effectively manage those risks. Sustainable supply chain management is about managing a supply chain effectively and transparently, as well as engaging with suppliers. This covers the process from supplier selection to procurement, evaluation, and promoting supplier compliance with a company’s sustainable business approach. Innovation development demonstrates how a company is committed to increasing their competitiveness in the midst of economic, social and environmental change, in order to respond to the needs of stakeholders and create value for the business and society.\n\n35\n\n4.3 Part 3:\n\nSustainability Performance\n\nA company’s sustainability management approach demonstrates how it is effectively managing each of its material topics, and the results of that management. To report on their sustainability performance, companies should adopt the following content structure.\n\n4.3.1\n\njectives and Targets Companies should report their objectives for each material topic and specify measurable targets that clearly indicate how they will meet those objectives. In addition, companies should demonstrate their efforts to comply with the rules, regulations or standards associated with that material topic.\n\nb\n\nO\n\nManagement Approach Companies should report on the steps that they take to manage each material topic. These should align with the objectives and targets that they have set for that material topic and include the following:\n\n4.3.2","2.

Reporting channels\n\nCompanies can decide on many different channels for communicating their sustainability information and performance. For example, sustainability information can be disclosed as part of the annual report, as a separate report, a sustainability report, or on a company website. Companies may choose one or more of these channels, but they must consider whether stakeholders can conveniently access this information.\n\n2. Report format\n\nCompanies should consider how each group of their stakeholders receives news and information. For example, if the target group prefers to consume information online, a company may need to prepare the files in an electronic format such as a PDF, e-Book, or QR Code, and distribute the report via digital formats. Alternatively, if the target group prefers printed media, a company may need to distribute this information in a printed format or a book.\n\nPresentation techniques Companies should present quantitative and qualitative information using language that is concise and easy to understand, and use formats such as infographics, diagrams, tables, and images in an organized way. This will help to stimulate interest for readers, make content easier to memorize, and enhance communications efficiency.\n\n3.\n\n21\n\n04\n\nElements of Sustainability Reporting\n\n4.1 Part 1:\n\nEssential Information\n\nCompanies should provide an overview of their business operations, as this will help information users to understand their operational context and the business activities that affect stakeholders.

Factors to consider:\n\ni. Is the management style and culture of your company more conducive to a collaborative approach, or specialized approach?\n\nii. Do existing committees have the requisite expertise to scrutinize climate risks and opportunities?\n\niii. Is there capacity for existing committees to expand their scope of work into climate- related efforts, in terms of leadership, time and resources?\n\n2\n\nBoard member(s) responsible for climate change issues should be in positions that will allow them to influence board decisions (eg committee chairs).\n\n{\tCompany X: The Corporate Governance Committee and Risk Management Committee,\n\nwhich comprises of four board members, have direct responsibility over approval of near- and long-term climate targets, renewable energy projects and internal carbon pricing mechanisms.

The\n\nteam works together to develop measures and plans to address specific risks based on\n\nthe risk response chosen. The planning process would provoke discussion about how the\n\nmeasures and plans should be supported by the overall business strategy. This facilitates\n\nthe consideration and integration of climate risks in business strategy planning.\n\nCompany X identified carbon pricing as a material transition risk as it operates energy-\n\nintensive manufacturing sites in different regions like the UK, EU, US and China. Each\n\nregion is subjected to different carbon pricing policies. The risk owner chooses “reduce”\n\nas the risk response to address the risk of carbon pricing. Regional teams are set up to\n\ndevelop measures and plans to reduce the severity of the risks brought by the regional\n\ncarbon pricing policies.

Reporting on TCFD recommendations Guidance on Climate Disclosures","The report then highlights and expands on three key areas of TCFD implementation, namely governance, climate scenario analysis and climate risk management. The purpose of this section is to provide practical guidance to companies who are looking to implement TCFD recommendations within their organization.\n\nThis report consolidates some examples of good practices, which are inspired by real-world use cases. These examples are used to illustrate how the TCFD recommendations are implemented and provide insights to companies to develop their own strategy and approach. The case studies and examples included in this report do not demonstrate the only approach to implementing the TCFD recommendations, but rather serve as examples to illustrate how they have been implemented in practice, which provides companies with a point of reference. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and companies should adapt the TCFD recommendations to their unique organizational context.\n\n| 3\n\nInterdependencies of the TCFD Pillars\n\nThe diagram below shows the interdependencies between all four TCFD pillars and highlights the importance of reporting. The TCFD pillars are governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.\n\nA well-established governance structure can ensure that climate issues are addressed across the organization as a matter of priority and in an effective manner. It is a prerequisite to effectively identifying, assessing and managing a wide spectrum of climate issues, as well as formulating an ambitious and practical climate strategy.\n\nRisk management is too often seen as a compliance exercise and not truly integrated with business strategy, objectives and decision-making. To effectively address climate challenges, business strategy should take climate-related issues into consideration. Through the climate risk identification and assessment exercise, companies can identify climate risks that are material to their business and choose the appropriate risk response to address those issues. However, adopting a risk response that is not aligned with the business strategy is ineffective to address climate risks. Climate risk responses that are in line with overall business strategies can ensure all levels of the company are working together to achieve a common goal.\n\nAdditionally, the importance of climate reporting is often underestimated by companies. It is worthwhile to note that reporting is an important tool to communicate a company’s performance and actions against climate-related issues. By disclosing climate-related issues in a transparent way, companies can receive valuable feedback from their internal and external stakeholders, including investors, on how they can further improve their climate governance, strategy, and risk management. Companies can then evaluate their approach and strategy on climate-related issues and update their stakeholders on any significant changes, forming an effective feedback loop.\n\nStrategy\n\nFeedback\n\nGovernance\n\nReporting\n\nClimate risk management (metrics and targets)\n\nClimate risk identiﬁcation and assessment\n\nFeedback\n\n| 4\n\nTCFD Journey Roadmap - identify your stage in the environmental journey\n\nThe TCFD roadmap, which is shown in the table below, describes the characteristics of four different environmental stages, namely early, developing, mature and best practice, based on the four TCFD pillars.

Analyse the climate risk assessment result and prioritize risks\n\nBased on the result of the climate risk assessment, a risk matrix can be constructed to visualize and analyse the materiality of all the climate risks, determining the priority of risks. Companies can determine the x-axis and y-axis of a risk matrix according to their own set of assessment criteria and scales.\n\nThe example of a risk matrix below shows a two-dimensional graph plotting vulnerability against hazard exposure. Hazard exposure refers to a company that is in a vulnerable setting or position while vulnerability is related to notions of resilience, flexibility and adaption. It refers to the propensity or predisposition of a company to suffer adversely from its exposure to hazards. Another example of a risk matrix can be a two- dimensional graph, in which the x-axis denotes impact, and the y-axis denotes likelihood.\n\nExample of a risk matrix\n\nVery high 5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nHigh 4\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\ne r u s o p x e d r a z a H\n\nModerate 3\n\nLow 2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n\n9\n\n6\n\n12\n\n8\n\n15\n\n10\n\nVery low 1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nVery low 1\n\nLow 2\n\nModerate 3\n\nHigh 4\n\nVery high 5\n\nVulnerability\n\nCategory 1\n\nRisks with very high materiality\n\nCategory 2\n\nRisks with high materiality\n\nCategory 3\n\nRisks with low materiality\n\nCategory 4\n\nRisks with very low materiality\n\nCompanies can categorize the risks based on their overall score and assign different levels of materiality to each category of risk. The example of a risk matrix above shows that the overall score of a risk is calculated by multiplying the hazard exposure rating by the vulnerability rating. For example, a risk gets four scores in hazard exposure and five scores in vulnerability. Its overall score is 20, which is multiplying four by five. Companies should develop their own calculation methodology and define different levels of materiality and its criteria. A risk matrix can be used to identify risks with different materiality levels and facilitate the risk prioritization process. With limited resources, companies may decide to prioritize addressing risks with high to highest materiality.\n\n| 21\n\nCase study – Climate Risk Assessment and Prioritization\n\nThe risks in the climate risk inventory are assessed by Company X’s expert team in terms\n\nof likelihood, time horizon, financial impact and response to risk. Company X has its own\n\ndefinition of time horizon. Short-term is defined as less than one year. Mid-term is defined as\n\nmore than one year but less than three years. Long-term is defined as three to nine years.\n\nCompany X forms an expert team, which includes representatives from different teams\n\nsuch as Sustainability, Procurement, Finance, Operations, Marketing and an external\n\nexpert on climate issues. The expert team is responsible for identifying climate risks and\n\nassessing the risks. A primary screening is conducted to remove risks that fall behind the\n\nlong-term time horizon, or that fall within the time horizon but are below the financial\n\nmateriality threshold of US$50 million.\n\nThe primary screening results of the assessment are shared with C-suite executives and","2.

Given this, reporting on a company’s sustainability risk management policy and guidelines is essential for showing that an organization has systematically considered risk control measures to mitigate any future impacts on its business. In addition, it reveals that a company has a process to control risks to within acceptable and controllable levels, and is able to review and respond effectively in the event of an incident, while maintaining their pursuit of organizational objectives. Furthermore, a company that has a risk management approach that aligns with international risk management principles, standards or guidelines demonstrates that it has a clear and internationally-accepted approach to sustainability risk management.\n\nSustainability risk factors Companies should report on the causes and origins of the economic, social, and environmental risks that could prevent them from achieving set targets.\n\nEmerging risks Emerging risks refer to upcoming events or changes that could impact a business. A company that reports its emerging risks demonstrates that it has considered measures to prepare for economic, social, and environmental change.\n\nBusiness continuity planning This shows how a company manages unexpected events that pose a threat to the organization or its stakeholders, and how it can carry on business activities or operations without interruption. This also indicates how a company is able to resume operations after facing a crisis or disaster.\n\n80\n\nReporting Approach A company should report the following information: 1. Risk management policy, guidelines, and framework covering environmental, social and\/or\n\ngovernance (ESG) issues. Specify the risk management standard or framework that the company uses within the organization, or for which it has received certification, e.g., COSO ERM, ISO 31000 (if applicable).\n\n2. Summary of ESG risk factors and explanations of how, where, and when the risk could occur. In specifying the possible causes of these sustainability risks, companies should specify the events that are likely to occur as well as provide a brief explanation of the mitigation measures for those risks.\n\n3. Summary of emerging risks that could affect the business over the short and long term. For example, climate change risks, water shortage risks, food security, and urbanization. Provide brief explanations of mitigation measures for emerging risks.\n\n4. Key summary of the plans, guidelines or risk response and mitigation measures that the company uses to respond to unexpected events. Examples include emergency plans, crisis management plans, and business continuity plans. These plans should clearly show objectives and targets to protect the business from a wide range of disasters and accidents, such as fires, floods, pandemics, and protests.\n\n5.

Firstly, it is essential to understand both the internal and external environments. This can be achieved through various approaches such as megatrend analysis, SWOT analysis, impacts and dependency mapping, stakeholder engagement, materiality assessment, and industry review. Utilizing resources like the TCFD recommendations and Global Risks Reports can help in identifying relevant climate risks.\n\nSecondly, building a climate risk inventory is crucial. This inventory should include a precise description of identified climate risks, their drivers, and their relevance to the business strategy, objectives, and performance. Regular reviews and updates of the climate risk inventory ensure that it remains holistic and relevant.\n\nThirdly, a risk assessment and prioritization process should be established. This involves setting criteria for assessing climate risks, such as likelihood, magnitude of impact, adaptability, and recovery. A well-defined rating scale for these criteria facilitates consistent interpretation and prioritization of risks.\n\nMoreover, it is important to ensure board-level oversight of climate issues. This includes integrating climate considerations into governance structures, strategic planning, and business models. Mechanisms should be in place to hold the board accountable for climate issues, and regular reporting of climate-related analyses and recommendations to the board is necessary.\n\nLastly, management responsibility over climate issues should be clearly defined, with executive management held accountable.
