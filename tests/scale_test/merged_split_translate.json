Project Outline\n\nRenewable energy or alternative energy substituted to fossil fuel 01 - Energy industries Emission reduction by grid connected electricity generation from renewable sources. Projects with primary objective are to generate electricity from renewable sources for selling to national electricity network after internal usage1 including the following activities: 1) Greenfield power plant establishment 2) Retrofit of an existing power plant 3) Rehabilitation of an existing power plant 4) Replacement of an existing power plant 1. Electricity production from one or combination of any types of renewable sources. 2. Primary project objective is to sell electricity to national grid network with internal usage. 3. Requires additional proof of Additionality by TGO T-VER criteria. The date is that the project owner (client) and the contractor have signed to construct the project of greenhouse gas emission reduction which will be developed to the T-VER project. Renewable Energy refers to a type of alternative energy produced from renewable resources such as solar, wind, hydro, biomass etc. Greenfield power plant refers to a new renewable power plant that is built and operated in an area where there is no renewable power plant prior to project activities. Retrofit of an existing power plant refer to investments in repairing or renovating existing power plants. To be able to produce more electricity or better efficiency without installing additional power generation systems This does not include regular maintenance. Rehabilitation of an existing power plant refers to investments in the restoration of existing power plants. but cannot be used due to severe damage or destruction due to natural disasters which may lead to optimization or the power generation capacity of the power\n\n5.

Replacement of an existing power plant refers to the investment to replace the power generation system National Grid means the electricity generation and distribution network in Thailand operated by Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) and Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA). Reservoir refers to a large basin created in a valley to store water. which is commonly used to build dams. Biomass residue means waste material from harvesting or processing agricultural commodities such as rice husks, sugarcane residue, rice straw, corncobs, etc., or wood and wood chips. that can be used to produce fuel 1 Generating electricity from renewable energy for distribution into the power grid with internal use refers to, for example, the project has an installed capacity of the electricity generating system from renewable energy of 8 MW, with 7 MW being sold into the power grid with 1 MW power plant parasitic loads and other internal consumptions. In such case, the project developer can apply this methodology to the 7 MW portion sold back to the electricity grid.\n\nThailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization) (TGO)\n\npage 3\n\nThailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Program\n\nT-VER-P-METH-01-01 Version 01\n\nDetails of T-VER methodology for Grid Connected Renewable Electricity Generation\n\n1.

Applicability and Scope of Project\n\nThe nature of the activity must be a project that generates electricity from renewable energy such as solar energy, wind energy, hydropower, and biomass energy, etc., by generating electricity for distribution into the electricity grid. or to sell to the electricity grid and use it yourself However, more than one technology can be used together to produce electricity.\n\nProject scope is electricity generation system from the project's renewable energy including\n\nvarious activities related to the Electricity generation of the project\n\nThere are characteristics of activities that fall into the additional scope. The details are as\n\nfollows.\n\n1) Hydroelectric power generation with a reservoir that meets at least one of the following\n\nconditions:\n\n(a) Project activities are carried out on existing reservoirs without changing the volume\n\nof the reservoir.\n\n(b) Project activities carried out in existing reservoirs; The volume of the reservoir increases and the power density of the project activities. According to the conditions set for greenhouse gas emissions from project implementation more than 4 W/m2 (c) Project activities result in a new reservoir and power density of the power plant meeting the conditions set for project implementation GHG emissions greater than 4 W/m2\n\n2) Project activities with the installation of new power generating units with components that use renewable energy and non-renewable (e.g., generating electricity from wind power coupled with diesel fuel). Project activities including renovation, rehabilitation, or replacement of the power generation system to replace the old one can be used.\n\n3) Electricity generation using cogeneration systems cannot use this method.\n\n4) Projects related to capacity increase cannot use this methodology.\n\n5) In the case of project activities that are generating electricity from gas from landfills Biogas from decomposing organic matter from waste and biogas from wastewater treatment Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from methane emissions avoided by recycling, use another methodology for calculations. But if the project developer has an activity that uses methane to produce electricity to sell to the electricity grid, this methodology can be used.\n\nThailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization) (TGO)\n\npage 5\n\nThailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Program\n\nT-VER-P-METH-01-01 Version 01",

However, the reduction from this activity is calculated using T-VER- P-METH-01-02 together with this methodology.\n\n3. Additionality\n\nThe project must undergo further proof of operation from normal operations. (Additionality) by using the \"Guidelines to prove operations in addition to normal operations. (Additionality) under the Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Program (T-VER)\" as prescribed by the TGO.\n\n4. Baseline Scenario\n\nConsidering the guidelines for determining the baseline data based on the concept of Below Business as Usual (Below BAU), the baseline data for greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation of the national grid substituting with renewable energy is the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation using natural gas in the national grid.\n\n4.1 Baseline Scenario for Greenfield power plants.\n\nBaseline scenario for the installation of new power plants is the generation of electricity from project activities for selling through the national grid, which increases capacity from new sources to the grid.\n\n4.2 Baseline Scenario for Retrofit, Rehabilitation or Replacement)\n\nFor project activities related to the improvement, restoration, or replacement of the existing power generation system, the base case is the situation of continuous operation of the existing power plant using historical power generation data to determine the amount of power generation of the original power plant in the base case. By assuming that the situation in the past before the implementation of the project activities. The power generation system will continue to be able to supply electricity to the grid at historical average levels until the time the power plant is likely to be renovated, restored, or replace the old one. and after that time onwards. The base case is the project activity, and that portion of the electricity generation will be equal to the net electricity quantity of the project. This will not be considered a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization) (TGO)\n\npage 6\n\nThailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Program\n\nT-VER-P-METH-01-01 Version 01\n\n5.
